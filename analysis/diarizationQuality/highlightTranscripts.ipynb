So I</font><font color = \"#4daf4a\"> imagine, maybe I am wrong, your job looked different before the pandemic compared to what it does now. What does the day to day of that look</font><font color = \"#000000\"> like?</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\"> Of course, it is very different because you know public health has two kinds of ways of working. One is the crisis mode and one is the ordinary mode and when you move to crisis mode there is a lot of different things to do and the organisation is very different and the very core of our activities during the last three months was supporting schools</font><font color = \"#999999\">,</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\"> supporting teachers, supporting education leaders in the way in which they could cope with the pandemic and also provide online education to students reflect on the way in which it impacts the learning of the kids and now which is the most important activity for us is to see at what condition schools could reopen, what are the measures that have to be implemented, what kind of relationship, what kind of work has to be done with schools</font><font color = \"#000000\">. Yes</font><font color = \"#377eb8\">, Devon. And for us, I think it is fair to say that most of the work that we do around young people\\'s health is focused at the moment on mental</font><font color = \"#999999\"> health</font><font color = \"#377eb8\"> and also sexual and</font><font color = \"#999999\"> reproductive</font><font color = \"#377eb8\"> health and what the pandemic has shown is that</font><font color = \"#999999\"> certainly</font><font color = \"#377eb8\"> the emphasis on mental health and young people\\'s health, you know, emotional</font><font color = \"#999999\"> wellbeing</font><font color = \"#377eb8\"> both within and well beyond</font><font color = \"#999999\"> the</font><font color = \"#377eb8\"> pandemic will be very important. But we\\'ve also been quite concerned about the closure of many health services and youth-friendly health</font><font color = \"#999999\"> services</font><font color = \"#377eb8\"> and services for young</font><font color = \"#999999\"> people</font><font color = \"#377eb8\">, the LGBTQ community, the transgender</font><font color = \"#999999\"> community</font><font color = \"#377eb8\">, some of the smaller services that were really needed. So it has been quite a</font><font color = \"#999999\"> real</font><font color = \"#377eb8\"> change for</font><font color = \"#999999\"> us</font><font color = \"#377eb8\"> over the last three months to carry on trying to support young</font><font color = \"#4daf4a\"> people. So I mean, we\\'re in the thick of it now and you kind of mentioned a few things there and things in terms of things that you\\'re noticing in education. What sort of things are you both noticing globally or maybe even locally where you\\'re at in terms of</font><font color = \"#999999\"> education</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\">? I\\'m not sure what to answer because, you know, globally, locally, this is</font><font color = \"#000000\"> a</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\"> very different scale. What do you</font><font color = \"#000000\"> think</font><font color = \"#377eb8\"> the key? And one of the first things that came to mind was that I am homeschooling two teenage boys myself at the</font><font color = \"#999999\"> moment</font><font color = \"#377eb8\"> and the different responses of each of those boys to the current situation and how it impacts on their learning has been interesting and also the conversations that I\\'ve had with their</font><font color = \"#999999\"> teachers</font><font color = \"#377eb8\"> either by email or by phone at this time has been very interesting and</font><font color = \"#999999\"> very</font><font color = \"#377eb8\"> supportive. But it\\'s very interesting to see the difference in provision and also talking</font><font color = \"#000000\"> to</font><font color = \"#377eb8\"> all the families and different</font><font color = \"#999999\"> schools</font><font color = \"#377eb8\">, the variation in development of online platforms that</font><font color = \"#000000\"> is</font><font color = \"#4daf4a\"> going on.</font><font color = \"#000000\"> Have you</font><font color = \"#4daf4a\"> noticed any maybe</font><font color = \"#999999\"> philosophical</font><font color = \"#4daf4a\"> shifts in the way that education is operating now or has anything kind of come to the forefront in schools as a result of the pandemic that you\\'ve noticed?</font><font color = \"#000000\"> Sure.</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\"> There\\'s a lot of changes in many ways.</font><font color = \"#999999\"> You</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\"> know, it\\'s a bit difficult to talk at the same time about the global trends and the little things you can observe at the local level. Clearly, I think that this is a relationship</font><font color = \"#999999\"> between</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\"> schools and</font><font color = \"#999999\"> parents</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\"> that have a</font><font color = \"#999999\">,</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\"> yes, really change. You know, the</font><font color = \"#999999\"> capacity</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\"> for</font><font color = \"#999999\"> schools</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\"> to contribute</font><font color = \"#999999\"> to</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\"> the</font><font color = \"#999999\"> learning</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\"> and the education of kids in this situation led to</font><font color = \"#999999\"> realize</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\"> that it</font><font color = \"#999999\"> could</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\"> work and that we are able to create this alliance between school, families and communities to cope with this situation. This is the first thing. The second thing is for me</font><font color = \"#000000\">,</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\"> a better awareness of the inequalities because you know this crisis played the role of a huge amplifier</font><font color = \"#999999\"> of</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\"> the inequalities for the families where there is no good day. Computers where the parents are far from the culture of the schools</font><font color = \"#999999\">,</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\"> of course, the impact of the pandemic is an iron than for the families for which the case. So for me, the main change is that yes, we could have kind of a relationship with the parents that is different than moving to this co-education process and at the same time, the awareness of the importance of the inequalities. This is for me two important shifts that I can observe at the global level. If you also think that, you know, it\\'s very difficult to add general comments, you know, because the schools in Canada, the USA, Europe and in Malawi, Burkina Faso, Algeria, allow a very, very different. But in general, this is more of this collaboration and the inequities that comes from what we observe in the</font><font color = \"#4daf4a\"> field. One of the things I think people are noticing right now is that there\\'s an overwhelming amount of information out</font><font color = \"#000000\"> there</font><font color = \"#4daf4a\"> now. Do you think that, you know, paradoxically, there\\'s also aspects of COVID or what\\'s happening in health and education that we aren\\'t giving sufficient enough attention to? Is there something you wish people were talking about that isn\\'t getting airplay</font><font color = \"#000000\">? Yes,</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\"> that\\'s called for trade. This is absolutely crucial now. You know, too much information, what kind of information? And we have developed resources and tools for schools and governments in order to push forward a work on this key question of information, fake news and critical sense about what comes from the internet. I think that clearly now we are more and more aware of the fact that, you know, health, it\\'s not just listening what is good for your health. It\\'s also being able to sort what kind of information are relevant and what information are not. Nikki?</font><font color = \"#000000\"> Yes,</font><font color = \"#377eb8\"> I totally agree. The issues of health literacy and critical looking</font><font color = \"#999999\"> at</font><font color = \"#377eb8\"> media is going to be very important and no doubt will be something that both teachers and students will be thinking about when</font><font color = \"#999999\"> they</font><font color = \"#377eb8\"> get back into the</font><font color = \"#999999\"> classroom</font><font color = \"#377eb8\">. I also have a particular interest in the situation for children and young people who have long-term</font><font color = \"#999999\"> conditions</font><font color = \"#377eb8\">. And I think that the present developments in things like the virtual</font><font color = \"#999999\"> platforms</font><font color = \"#377eb8\"> and also in telemedic</font><font color = \"#000000\">ine</font><font color = \"#377eb8\"> perhaps raises some issues of, you know, lost days of</font><font color = \"#999999\"> education</font><font color = \"#377eb8\"> that young people with, you know, childhood cancers or, you know, arthritic</font><font color = \"#999999\"> conditions</font><font color = \"#377eb8\"> might have been, you know, might have had for years and years and now because we\\'re thinking about how to better provide for students at home</font><font color = \"#999999\"> that</font><font color = \"#377eb8\"> their inequalities may in some ways</font><font color = \"#999999\"> improve</font><font color = \"#377eb8\">. But I think that the real acid test</font><font color = \"#999999\"> is</font><font color = \"#377eb8\"> going to be as the school doors start to open</font><font color = \"#999999\"> again</font><font color = \"#377eb8\">, what are families, viewpoints around sending</font><font color = \"#999999\"> young</font><font color = \"#377eb8\"> people and children with long-term conditions with chronic illness back to school, you know, if your, you know, if your child has asthma, how are you going to feel about that</font><font color = \"#000000\">?</font><font color = \"#377eb8\"> But the data says that, you know, with the right social distancing</font><font color = \"#999999\"> and</font><font color = \"#377eb8\"> hygiene techniques that these children and young people will do very well back in</font><font color = \"#999999\"> school</font><font color = \"#377eb8\"> and</font><font color = \"#999999\"> indeed</font><font color = \"#377eb8\">, you know, the impacts of socialization on their mental health and</font><font color = \"#999999\"> wellbeing</font><font color = \"#377eb8\"> and physical exercise as they, you know, get back into</font><font color = \"#999999\"> society</font><font color = \"#377eb8\"> will far</font><font color = \"#999999\"> outweigh</font><font color = \"#377eb8\"> any risk that we don\\'t actually think is increased for those children and young people.</font><font color = \"#000000\"> Can</font><font color = \"#4daf4a\"> you actually maybe expand on that a bit? Like what do we know about COVID and young people? And maybe is there a difference between what we suspect and what we know</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\">? This is extremely important to begin by the beginning. It means what do we know at the time? But we also have to be aware and this is extremely important. We have two sources of knowledge. It\\'s not only the science and the experiments, it\\'s also the</font><font color = \"#999999\"> practices</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\"> and the knowledge of the real people in the</font><font color = \"#999999\"> field</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\">. And if I say that, this is because we miss some data. You know, when you do the reviews, you miss some data. But what is absolutely fantastic is to realize that some countries have schools which are open from the beginning are schools that reopen at the end of February. So the question is not only to know what do we know from research but also what we could learn from principals, teachers, headmasters in these countries. And this is the work we did with the WHO Collaborating Center and the UNESCO Chair is first of all to make a review and clearly, you know, it\\'s now well recognized that the contribution of the school closure to the management of the pandemic is very low. It\\'s between two and four persons. So it\\'s not a lot. There\\'s risks, of course, but they are very limited. But what\\'s important to know is that the impact of the school closure is extremely important for the kids. And it is well documented that few months as an impact on the knowledge, you know, the World Bank make a model and</font><font color = \"#999999\"> shows</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\"> that when you lose a year, you lose 2.5% of income in your life. If you miss a year is 10% of income and it means that if you miss schools for half a year, it\\'s 5% and if it\\'s only three months, it\\'s 2.5. So what we know from the biography is that clearly huge impact of school closure and the interest is limited</font><font color = \"#999999\"> concerning</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\"> the questions of the transmission of the virus. We have information from the research showing that this transmission is limited and we have to say clearly that there are two different cases</font><font color = \"#000000\">.</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\"> There\\'s preschool and primary school on the one hand and middle school and high school on the other hand. It\\'s clear that it\\'s very relevant</font><font color = \"#999999\"> to</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\"> reopen kindergarten and primary school because the risk of transmission and the half consequences are very low. Concerning the middle school and the high school, it\\'s pretty different because there\\'s a</font><font color = \"#999999\"> risk</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\"> of propagation of the virus. So this is what we can learn from the research</font><font color = \"#999999\"> and</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\"> at the same time, we make</font><font color = \"#999999\"> an</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\"> inquiry in order to learn from one example in Taiwan or in Sweden or in many African countries for which schools are still open and it will be clear that the kids are able to wear masks and then if the social distancing measures are operating in the schools,</font><font color = \"#999999\"> there</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\">\\'s no new epidemic and new</font><font color = \"#999999\"> clusters</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\"> of a virus</font><font color = \"#999999\"> transmission</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\">. This is what</font><font color = \"#000000\"> we know at the</font><font color = \"#377eb8\"> time. May I just add that as far as children and</font><font color = \"#999999\"> young</font><font color = \"#377eb8\"> people with long-term conditions, chronic illness are</font><font color = \"#999999\"> concerned</font><font color = \"#377eb8\">, apart from those who are taking treatments that will suppress their immune</font><font color = \"#999999\"> system</font><font color = \"#377eb8\">. For</font><font color = \"#999999\"> many</font><font color = \"#377eb8\"> children and young people with well-</font><font color = \"#999999\">controlled</font><font color = \"#377eb8\"> chronic illness</font><font color = \"#999999\"> like</font><font color = \"#377eb8\"> asthma, there is no real elevated risk of going back. As I said, as long as they observe the other measures that are put in place,</font><font color = \"#000000\"> I</font><font color = \"#377eb8\"> was speaking to a pediatrician colleague in Denmark who was saying that there was some anxiety about their patients with asthma heading back to schools</font><font color = \"#000000\">,</font><font color = \"#377eb8\"> but they\\'ve coped very well and she actually remarked that they may be coping better than some other students because they are very tuned in</font><font color = \"#999999\"> to</font><font color = \"#377eb8\"> thinking about how to keep themselves well and being sensible at school. It\\'s an interesting situation.</font><font color = \"#000000\"> You</font><font color = \"#4daf4a\"> both said some things that I pick up on. What I\\'m hearing you say and correct me if I\\'m wrong is that schools in general could be open. It sounds like you\\'re saying with the risk of transmission being low. My original question was going to be what are the conditions where you think a school ought to reopen, but it sounds like you\\'re saying, well, as long as there\\'s not a massive outbreak, maybe they could all</font><font color = \"#000000\"> be open now.</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\"> Yes, clearly, they could be open now with a couple of conditions. The first one is that it has to be a progressive process. Just in order to check that in certain conditions, there\\'s no special risk. Second, it has to be a differentiated process. Depending on the facilities, depending on the density of population</font><font color = \"#999999\">,</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\"> depending on the organization of school transportation of the canteen, it could need more time and different adjustment for the schools. So clearly, progressive, differentiated and concerning the measures to be taken to protect student and staff. Clearly, the research that I confirmed that the value of social distancing combined with frequent hand washing or san</font><font color = \"#999999\">itiz</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\">er use, you know that it works. It\\'s very clear. The best example is Taiwan. They reopened the school on the 25th of February, and at the time, I can tell you that no primary schools were affected by an epidemic,</font><font color = \"#999999\"> only</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\"> four schools, three universities and one high school. This is only what happens. So the social distancing measures plus hand washing works. During the mask, it\\'s also a control issue that now recent reviews and the experience of the people in the field that the teachers and the principal led to recommend widespread adoption of the use of the masking school. So yes, now,</font><font color = \"#999999\"> of</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\"> course, progressively with a</font><font color = \"#999999\"> differentiated</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\"> approach and</font><font color = \"#999999\"> with</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\">, of course, all the social distancing</font><font color = \"#377eb8\"> measures. I think as well, one of the</font><font color = \"#999999\"> understandable</font><font color = \"#377eb8\"> concerns will be from teachers and parents themselves</font><font color = \"#999999\"> about</font><font color = \"#377eb8\"> what is going to happen when children and youth go back to</font><font color = \"#999999\"> schools</font><font color = \"#377eb8\">. And we recommend that, you know, that this is, this is why the intersectional approach is so necessary, that in localities, the principals, parents, governors, student representatives should be in conversation and thinking about what is going to happen for their own</font><font color = \"#999999\"> school</font><font color = \"#377eb8\"> so that we address parents\\' concerns, students\\' concerns, teachers</font><font color = \"#999999\">\\'</font><font color = \"#377eb8\"> concerns</font><font color = \"#999999\"> before</font><font color = \"#377eb8\"> they go back. Because otherwise, I think we will see high levels of</font><font color = \"#999999\"> absentee</font><font color = \"#377eb8\">ism for all the reasons that we\\'ve, you know, tried</font><font color = \"#000000\"> to explain</font><font color = \"#4daf4a\">. So I want to try to touch on a couple of the medical things so I can understand the better first before maybe the practical school aspect of it. One of the things you talked about was the idea of the low risk. Do we know the long-term, long-term effect of this? There\\'s some indication now that people, even if they didn\\'t die, may have long-term organ failure. Is not being dead a high enough bar for</font><font color = \"#999999\"> us</font><font color = \"#999999\">? You\\'re right</font><font color = \"#377eb8\"> that these are some major concerns at the moment, that there have been some longer term syndromes implicated in infection and recovery with COVID-</font><font color = \"#999999\">19</font><font color = \"#377eb8\">. I don\\'t think we\\'re in a position to speculate on, you know, those associations. But yes</font><font color = \"#000000\">,</font><font color = \"#377eb8\"> I think what we\\'ve been trying to do is find the balance within this situation that we know for so many</font><font color = \"#999999\"> reasons</font><font color = \"#377eb8\"> that for all children and young</font><font color = \"#999999\"> people</font><font color = \"#377eb8\">, their life prospects are enhanced by having a fantastic education and being in school and socialising with their</font><font color = \"#999999\"> peers</font><font color = \"#377eb8\">. And so we have, we weigh that against all the other information that comes in about possible risks</font><font color = \"#000000\">.</font><font color = \"#377eb8\"> I think the DMA would wish to say some more</font><font color = \"#000000\"> about that. No</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\">, this is just to say that it\\'s always a question of balance between the benefits and the risk. You are totally right. We don\\'t</font><font color = \"#999999\"> know</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\">. We don\\'t know. We don\\'t know what could happen. You know, this is a very recent epitome. So we don\\'t know what kind of long term syndromes will be observed in the future. We have good reasons</font><font color = \"#999999\"> to</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\"> think that it won\\'t be extremely important because as you know, there were two epitomies of that kind of various, the SARS-CoV areas, the SARS and another epitome 10 years ago. So at the time, there\\'s a risk and there probably will be for a smaller proportion of people, long term impact. But the key question in that kind of situation is always to find a good balance between the</font><font color = \"#999999\"> consequences</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\">. And</font><font color = \"#000000\"> at</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\"> the time, we</font><font color = \"#999999\"> have</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\"> good reasons to think that there\\'s far more</font><font color = \"#999999\"> consequences at</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\"> closing</font><font color = \"#999999\"> schools</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\"> than at opening schools, including in terms of consequences on health. Don\\'t forget that not going to school, for example, for the most vulnerable kids, it\\'s not having a meal at the canteen. It\\'s not having access to social and half school health services. So yes, you know, we cannot predict the future. There\\'s potential risk. We will discover probably some consequences in the future. But at the time, based on the knowledge and the experience we have, clearly the decision has to be in favor of re</font><font color = \"#4daf4a\">opening. So when you mentioned that keeping schools closed would prevent 2 to 4% of deaths, which is a pretty low percent, but in a population of a million, I mean, that becomes a bigger number. I guess as a health and education expert, what would be the percent where you would say schools ought to be closed?</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\"> Yeah, I don\\'t think, you know, we can\\'t reply like this</font><font color = \"#999999\"> because</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\"> it\\'s always the question you know, \"I\\'ll do</font><font color = \"#999999\"> outcomes</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\">.\" And there\\'s multiple</font><font color = \"#999999\"> outcomes</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\">. So it\\'s pretty difficult to say what is the percentage of avoided death</font><font color = \"#999999\"> that</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\"> could define if it is good or not to close the school. We have to take into account many, many outcomes in the analysis. You know, think about also something which is terrible, you know, which is the family violence. I\\'m sorry to say, but it\\'s just true. Having all the kids at home generate an increase in the family violence, and this is also one of the impact of the pandemic. And then this is a complicated decision to decide what\\'s the best solution. So it\\'s not a question of percentage. It\\'s more having a</font><font color = \"#999999\"> comprehensive</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\"> view, going progressively, because imagine if your province of Manitoba, for example, if after reopening schools, you discover that in two schools, there\\'s a new epidemic. Then it</font><font color = \"#999999\"> means</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\"> for a reason we don\\'t know, you have to stop the process and to see what happened and to realize and then to close the school again at the time. For example, in</font><font color = \"#999999\"> Denmark</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\">, after two</font><font color = \"#999999\"> weeks</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\">, nothing happened,</font><font color = \"#999999\"> nothing</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\"> happened at the time. So</font><font color = \"#999999\"> things</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\"> are moving forward. So you cannot decide what\\'s the percentage. The key question is the balance between the benefits and the risk to see what is possible in the</font><font color = \"#999999\"> field</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\"> and then to decide by moving progressively</font><font color = \"#000000\">. Our</font><font color = \"#377eb8\"> colleague in Taiwan told us about the closure rules for schools that were enacted at the national level. But then played out through a</font><font color = \"#999999\"> local</font><font color = \"#377eb8\"> level. If one teacher or student had an</font><font color = \"#999999\"> infection</font><font color = \"#377eb8\"> after the schools reopened, then the school was</font><font color = \"#999999\"> closed</font><font color = \"#377eb8\"> again. And then it was if I think three, if more students were affected, then the whole school.</font><font color = \"#999999\"> No</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\">, it\\'s three. You\\'re</font><font color = \"#999999\"> totally</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\"> right. If one</font><font color = \"#999999\">,</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\"> the students or teacher is</font><font color = \"#999999\"> affected</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\">, the class has to be closed and people have to stay home for two</font><font color = \"#999999\"> weeks</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\">. If you have more than three cases in the school, you close the school. But again, it happens only four times and only four high school and colleges in Taiwan. At the time, no schools were closed in Sweden and no in Denmark. So this is where we are. But again, we cannot predict the future. We cannot predict the future. That\\'s why we have to be careful and we have to organize the</font><font color = \"#999999\"> schools</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\"> in a way that it makes possible to respect the social dist</font><font color = \"#4daf4a\">ancing procedures. In the article that you wrote in the conversation, you identified four strategies</font><font color = \"#999999\"> for</font><font color = \"#4daf4a\"> reopening. I think we\\'ve kind of touched on all those a little bit. Can you name them for schools they\\'re listening? So they are really aware of what</font><font color = \"#999999\"> those</font><font color = \"#4daf4a\"> strategies</font><font color = \"#000000\"> would be.</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\"> Yes, for us, there\\'s four very important points. The first one we already talked about is the differentiated and progressive system. The second is an organization very concrete to protect students and</font><font color = \"#999999\"> staff</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\">. The third is the idea of developing the an hybrid pedagogical approach because don\\'t forget that in this context, we will still have times at home. We will still have some kids home. So it means that it\\'s not to move from distance learning to face to face learning. We</font><font color = \"#999999\"> still</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\"> stay</font><font color = \"#999999\"> in</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\"> the view of the hybrid pedagogical approach. And finally, and first it\\'s very important, we have to use this very special time to</font><font color = \"#999999\"> renew</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\"> the vision we have of the epidemic and to help children and young people to have a very</font><font color = \"#999999\"> different</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\"> vision and understanding of what is an epidemic. You know, in the very old-fashioned classical view, it\\'s a war</font><font color = \"#999999\"> between</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\"> a bad guy, the various and a good guy, the human beings. We have to move forward because it\\'s not like this at all. It\\'s more the question of the balance, the relationship between different spaces on the planet. And then there is a need for people to understand that this balance between the different spaces will have to be built in a good way because the virus never</font><font color = \"#999999\"> disappear</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\">. A bad joy is to limit the transmission, to limit the negative impact. But it\\'s more having a kind of ecosystem view on the epidemic. So four ideas, the differentiated and progressive system, an organization to protect the students and staff. And I bring a pedagogical approach. And because this is our job in</font><font color = \"#999999\"> schools</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\">, educate using this</font><font color = \"#999999\"> crisis</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\"> to work with students on what is a virus, what is a pandemic, what is health, what are the health determinants, and how to</font><font color = \"#999999\"> live</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\"> with all the other species on the planet.</font><font color = \"#4daf4a\"> Nicholas,</font><font color = \"#999999\"> anything</font><font color = \"#999999\"> you</font><font color = \"#377eb8\"> want</font><font color = \"#000000\"> to add?</font><font color = \"#377eb8\"> No, it was beautifully</font><font color = \"#4daf4a\"> said. So the one of those that interested me the most from a practical standpoint was thinking about the organizing to protect students and staff. Because that one, I guess to me, provided the most opportunities for doing something different, to rethinking how things work. One of the things that you mentioned was maybe different students would be at school different times of day. One week on, one week off for someone else, or maybe a staggered start where certain students come in and other ones come in. Is it reasonable to expect that all students could come back? I\\'m thinking of the classrooms that I\\'ve</font><font color = \"#999999\"> taught</font><font color = \"#4daf4a\"> in of almost always 30 or more students. Maintaining social</font><font color = \"#000000\"> dist</font><font color = \"#4daf4a\">ancing would be a challenge, probably impossible in those situations. Do we need to get used to an idea that all of our students are not going to be in the same room at the same</font><font color = \"#000000\"> time?</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\"> Oh, sure. At the time, it\\'s not realistic. And it\\'s not sensible to imagine that you\\'re going to have, you know, schools working business as usual. It has to be again a progressive process because we don\\'t</font><font color = \"#999999\"> know</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\"> what will happen. So clearly at the time, we at the time we are doing a survey at the global level to see what people are doing again to learn from the</font><font color = \"#999999\"> field</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\">. For example, think at our colleagues from the</font><font color = \"#999999\"> Netherlands</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\">, they have decided that the most vulnerable person in the classroom is</font><font color = \"#999999\"> the</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\"> teacher, which is true, in</font><font color = \"#999999\"> fact</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\">. So it means that the main protective measures for</font><font color = \"#999999\"> the</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\"> teacher, so it means that they the social distancing is a more important between the teachers and the students, then between the students. In many,</font><font color = \"#999999\"> many</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\"> countries, it\\'s half class and this is what you said. One week off or for example, Monday, Tuesday for half of the class and Thursday Friday. There\\'s no, you know, one size does not fit whole. You don\\'t know. You know, for example, in some countries, it\\'s not 30, it\\'s 60 kids per class in small rooms. It won\\'t</font><font color = \"#999999\"> work</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\"> as in some places. For example, in Denmark, in Denmark, the number of students is low. So it means they can reopen the school. I would say 80%. In some cases, it\\'s only 20%. But it\\'s not</font><font color = \"#999999\"> realistic</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\"> to</font><font color = \"#999999\"> reopen</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\"> immediately. There\\'s a need to have a progressive process and to see what happens and if we can move to less countries. But at the time, in our experience and what we see, every school, for example, in France, is we have reopened the school last</font><font color = \"#999999\"> Monday</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\">, every school found a way to reorganize the schools and respecting the social distancing. But don\\'t forget we have to protect the adults more than the kids in schools. So don\\'t forget to protect staff and not only students</font><font color = \"#000000\">. Yes, we</font><font color = \"#377eb8\">\\'ve seen some different means of distancing as well. Our colleague in Taiwan</font><font color = \"#999999\"> told</font><font color = \"#377eb8\"> us about the perspex barriers that they have put up between desks. And I guess it\\'s possible, as I\\'ve seen in some stores over here, that you could have perspex screens between the students and the teachers. I can certainly say that if we get the students involved, as well as all the other stakeholders in schools to think about their own plan for going back to school, I am quite sure that they will be</font><font color = \"#999999\"> creative</font><font color = \"#377eb8\">. Another</font><font color = \"#999999\"> difference</font><font color = \"#377eb8\"> that we see mainly here in our high schools is that usually in high</font><font color = \"#999999\"> schools</font><font color = \"#377eb8\">, the students move</font><font color = \"#999999\"> to</font><font color = \"#377eb8\"> the teachers\\' room. So they\\'re moving between lessons</font><font color = \"#999999\"> all</font><font color = \"#377eb8\"> the time. But why can\\'t the</font><font color = \"#999999\"> teacher</font><font color = \"#377eb8\"> move and instead leaving the students in place socially distanced and the teachers move between the rooms all day? So there are lots of... but it\\'s really down to... one approach will not fit all schools. It will depend on the premises, how new they are, how spacious rooms are, what kind of flexible space they\\'ve got to play</font><font color = \"#999999\"> with</font><font color = \"#377eb8\">. So it\\'s really important that a school community with all its stakeholders has a say. And some of the things that we\\'ve really got to take into account as well are the services that are important for schools, but not controlled by schools. And so, you know, school transport, I guess, is going to be a big issue. Social distancing on school buses, especially for schools and countries where that\\'s very, you know, that\\'s got a very efficient system of national school buses, then, you know, these services will also need to be taken into account to minimise</font><font color = \"#999999\"> risk</font><font color = \"#4daf4a\">. I\\'ve got two last questions.</font><font color = \"#000000\"> And it</font><font color = \"#4daf4a\">\\'s taken me this long to realise that maybe I\\'ve been asking the wrong question all this time. So I appreciate the conversation because I think it\\'s clarified what I maybe actually meant. And I think what a lot of people actually mean when they ask the question, when should schools reopen? Because you\\'ve given a very clear answer of how they could open right now. But I think what people are actually wondering is, when can schools reopen as we knew them before the pandemic? So I guess my question is, is that even a reality anymore, or are there certain conditions we could be looking for to say, yes, it is now safe to go back to business as</font><font color = \"#999999\"> usual</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\">? This is a very good question. And frankly, at the time, at UNI, I don\\'t have scientific evidence. But be aware that it is a</font><font color = \"#999999\"> process</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\"> that the human kind have to face epidemics from the beginning of its history. So what happened with this epidemic is going to be exactly the same as all the epidemics in the past. I think at the Spanish flu and its terrible impact, after a little bit down a year</font><font color = \"#999999\">,</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\"> I mean the life came back to what it was in the past. So for me, what I can see that, again, I don\\'t have evidence for</font><font color = \"#999999\"> that</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\">. But until the end of</font><font color = \"#999999\"> this</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\"> summer,</font><font color = \"#999999\"> there</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\"> is no hope for</font><font color = \"#999999\"> me</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\"> that schools would come back to business as usual.</font><font color = \"#999999\"> For</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\"> me, it\\'s not</font><font color = \"#999999\"> realistic</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\">. We have to learn to work in a different way. And depending on the way in which the population will be analyzed, I mean after the summer break, we\\'ll see what kind of organization will be able to implement. But clearly, for me, it\\'s not realistic that for the next four months, we will come back to the normal activity of schools. And the decisions, for example, limiting the relationship or coming back to the normal life in the school yard, for example, this decision has to be taken depending on the level of the immunity of the population. And probably, I would say September could be a good test. And depending on the result, we could come back. But be sure that one day or another, we will be back to the school. But I\\'m sure that it won\\'t be different. Yes, we will still have the same classrooms, the same teacher and the same kids. But the one which we will teach in the future will be</font><font color = \"#000000\"> a bit different.</font><font color = \"#377eb8\"> I agree. I think there are several issues in this one. And of course, I</font><font color = \"#999999\"> would</font><font color = \"#377eb8\"> like to think that</font><font color = \"#000000\"> within</font><font color = \"#999999\"> years</font><font color = \"#377eb8\"> that we will be</font><font color = \"#999999\"> back</font><font color = \"#377eb8\"> to what we see at the moment in</font><font color = \"#999999\"> terms</font><font color = \"#377eb8\"> of</font><font color = \"#999999\"> students</font><font color = \"#377eb8\"> being face to face with their</font><font color = \"#999999\"> peers</font><font color = \"#377eb8\">, with their teachers,</font><font color = \"#999999\"> with</font><font color = \"#377eb8\"> the people who give them social support while they are at school, because we know how important that is for their health and well-being. And we also know that the schools and when children are in schools, that it also facilitates the movement of parents back into work. And so whilst I totally agree that I think that for</font><font color = \"#999999\"> the</font><font color = \"#377eb8\"> next few months we are going to see split weeks and some disruption of the time spent at school, I think that society will want to go back to a more predictable</font><font color = \"#999999\"> pattern</font><font color = \"#377eb8\"> of school attendance so</font><font color = \"#999999\"> that</font><font color = \"#377eb8\"> the whole family can get back to its economic activity.</font><font color = \"#000000\"> But</font><font color = \"#377eb8\"> I totally agree that a question is, should we go back to school in the same way? And I think that DGA has given very good reasons for why we will learn a lot from this pandemic. And hopefully we will use it to better serve children and young people who cannot</font><font color = \"#999999\"> spend</font><font color = \"#377eb8\"> time at</font><font color = \"#999999\"> school</font><font color = \"#377eb8\"> because of severe special</font><font color = \"#999999\"> healthcare</font><font color = \"#377eb8\"> needs. That we may find that some children</font><font color = \"#999999\"> with</font><font color = \"#377eb8\"> no particular special needs but just respond really well to having a flexible virtual platform that it suits their way of</font><font color = \"#999999\"> learning</font><font color = \"#377eb8\">. And so I look forward to what I</font><font color = \"#999999\"> think</font><font color = \"#377eb8\"> will be a lot of research coming out very quickly over the next 12 months about exactly what we have learned from this strange</font><font color = \"#000000\"> time</font><font color = \"#4daf4a\">. And so my last question is, if people want to have the best information, if they want to know what\\'s going on and keep themselves informed in a responsible way,</font><font color = \"#999999\"> where</font><font color = \"#4daf4a\"> should they be going</font><font color = \"#000000\"> for that</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\"> information? I would say by definition, WHO is the best source of</font><font color = \"#999999\"> information</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\"> for the medical dimension and for the educational dimension. This is UNESCO. Please tell your colleagues and the teachers in your province that they could access to a very good document made by UNESCO about school reopening. And there\\'s a web page on the UNESCO website about the current station, the challenges and the data. And finally, they could go to the website of the UNESCO chair and WHO, Coronavirus Center in Global Health and Education. We have a page in</font><font color = \"#999999\"> which</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\"> we select all the important publications and</font><font color = \"#999999\"> especially</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\"> the one about schools and COVID-19. And for example, we just had a paper that has been published this morning about the new mobilization of the impact of the opening of primary</font><font color = \"#999999\"> school</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\"> and kindergarten. So WHO, UNESCO and the chair, and also there\\'s a lot of other websites.</font><font color = \"#999999\"> Nikki</font><font color = \"#377eb8\">? I would say it\\'s worth watching the National Associations for Children and Young People\\'s Health and the Professional Societies, like the Royal Colleges, the American Academy of Pediatrics, the International Ped</font><font color = \"#999999\">iatric</font><font color = \"#377eb8\"> Association are all doing, are all providing really useful information. Some of it is aimed at clinicians, but I\\'m aware of several national associations for children and young people\\'s health who are signposting</font><font color = \"#999999\"> parents</font><font color = \"#377eb8\"> to reputable sources of information about</font><font color = \"#999999\"> health</font><font color = \"#377eb8\"> and education and all kinds of</font><font color = \"#999999\"> social</font><font color = \"#377eb8\"> support in the light of the COVID pandemic. So yes, those are the kinds of associations to go</font><font color = \"#4daf4a\"> to. Did you, Nicola, thank you both so much for your time across the ocean coming to you. I really</font><font color = \"#999999\"> appreciate</font><font color = \"#4daf4a\"> all the</font><font color = \"#999999\"> knowledge</font><font color = \"#4daf4a\"> you\\'ve given</font><font color = \"#000000\">.</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\"> Thank you so much.
