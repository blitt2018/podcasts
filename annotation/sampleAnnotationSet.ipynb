      "*The Antherian -, \"The Antherian\"\" plays* Hello and welcome to Book Fight, a podcast about reading and writing that has been called many different things in the years since it began, but never once painterly. I'm Mike Ingram, I'm here with Tom Calister. Tom, have you ever described something as painterly? I have not, I don't think it would have, I wish that we had had that in our arsenal for when we're doing blurbs for people, which was, you know, a long time listeners know it was a real staple of the show for the middle four years. Could have called all kinds of things painterly. That's one of those things that I kind of know what people are getting at, but kind of don't when they describe writing as painterly. Yeah, did you see related to that, I retweeted from the Book Fight account, I forget who shared it, but it was an image of a blurb that Ben Lerner wrote for someone where he described a book as breath giving instead of breathtaking. In these times that's the best thing a book could be. That's true, that's true. I mean, until we develop a cure for COVID-19, people just need to get that book. There's a lot of pressure on that author or at least the booksellers. I mean, our hospitals may be running low on ventilators, but maybe we got copies of that book. Just give everyone a copy of the book. Yeah. Thoughts, prayers and this illuminating breath giving novel. I don't even remember what the book was. And it's certainly not the author, the author got a blurb from Blint Ben Lerner. So you're like, yeah, sure, let's go with it. Yeah, of course. But I guess you can't write back and be like,...\n",

You are not a biological accident. It is not uncommon to hear some pregnant women complaining about all long-term pregnancies. There was no intention to have a child, but young, controllable passion, as they led to the process of fertilization of an egg by his parmatosia. The egg may be done within the leg it may be two walls of marriage with constant awe. It may be forced with the no outside the marching on it. Either way, a baby is on its way. It may be that unwanted or a biological accident, but in gross agenda, it is not. Soloma was a product of our torturing. The act of our daughter that brought into this world, asked not to do with the royal destiny bestowed on him. The wiser king ever lived was a product of electric-made relationship. We are not a product of biological accidents. The cause of our destiny was predetermined before our path. Our parents adjusted the chance through what God decided to bring us into this world. God told Jeremiah\"\" \"In the book of the romantic of one past five, he said\"\" \"Before I formed you, I knew you,.\" In other words, everything that he had was to accomplish on an egg had been fully determined even before the remark was formed. The purpose precedes creation. Like Jeremiah, God knew us and mapped out our path in destiny before he found us in our mother's womb. Our mother's womb are like vehicles that converge to the examination centers. The type of vehicle a student comes with does not determine the performance...\n",

      "Please like and subscribe to our channel. Leave your questions and feedback in the comments section in your video. Continuing from the last podcast, which was discussing, Chapter 7, verse 168. And we divided them throughout the earth into nations. Of them, some were righteous and of them, some were otherwise. This verse also indicates the importance of companionship. It is important for Muslims to accompany those who have submitted to the obedience of Allah, the exalted which involves fulfilling the commands of Allah, the exalted, refraining from his prohibitions and being patient with destiny according to the traditions of the holy people. Because of the holy prophet Muhammad, peace and blessings be upon him. Every person will be affected by their companion in a negative or a positive way. Whether this effect is apparent or subtle, this has been confirmed in a narration found in Sunan, Abu, Dawud, Number 4 829. If a Muslim accompanies someone who is obedient to Allah, the exalted, they will be affected in a positive way. It is why the holy Quran advised Muslims to accompany the truthful ones. Chapter 9, verse 119. Fear Allah and be with those who are true. Conversely, if a Muslim accompanies someone who is not obedient to Allah, the exalted, they will undoubtedly be influenced in a negative way. This will only lead to regret in this world, such as crimes and prison and in the next world. Chapter 25, verse 28. Oh, whoa to me. I wish I had not taken that one as a friend. Allah, the exalted, has summed up this important principle in a few words by declaring that all friends will become enemies to one another on judgment day, except for the righteous as they influenced each other in a positive way.

So you're going to see what's in till summer? Yeah, just a lot of slowing down. Yeah, well, I mean, it's funny what you say the thing about despair. It's not good to hear that you're experiencing despair, but in a way, it's actually kind of comforting to me. It's kind of easier from others, having a tough time. Absolutely. Like, I took a photo of myself in the show with a couple of friends. I took a photo of myself the other day, because I was like, I can't make my face move. It's stuck in a-- in like a-- not even a frown. It's like my skin on my-- the flesh on my skull is slipping off. I can't actually smile right now.

      "I felt as if I had no faith left. Family and friends telling me it was not possible for me to achieve something I felt so passionate about. What was the point in the playing softball if it was so unreal for me to get to the college level? At first I let it get to me. I almost quit softball altogether, but I decided that as long as I had faith in what I believed in I could accomplish anything I wanted. Faith is key to having a clear and successful life. You need to have complete trust and confidence in yourself as well as others or you won't get anything done. My parents and coaches are the ones who believed in me. They did everything they could to help me accomplish my goals. On the other hand, mainly my friends thought it was dreamlike for me to have college softball as a goal. All I ever heard was, \"you're from Henry County, you won't get noticed by a division 1 college, one of the chances and you aren't good enough,.\" I never really said anything about these negative comments. I usually just left them off. As my friends sat there and had no faith in me, my parents tried to cancel out their negative comments in positive ones. When I was at school I felt bad about my goals. I had because nobody else thought I could accomplish them, but while I was at home I thought I could because I was surrounded by people who believed in me. As I got older my dreams seemed to be coming closer to me like almost an arms reach. All the hard work was starting to get more and more noticed by those division 1 colleges that I had no...\n",

Presence, the word presence, the definition is to feel and understand that someone in a place even when they may or may not be seen. Well, most of the time we don't see God's presence. We see the evidence of His presence, but we don't necessarily see His presence. I remember one service a number of years ago he was in a revival with a man named Brother Fred Williams. He was an Indian man preaching and the Spirit of God got so strong in that service probably the only time I ever remember seeing it that it got so strong, the presence of God did. It was so powerful and so thick that it looked like a haze over the congregation. I'll never forget that. I know that there's things that people do sometimes and make them mockery, but I'll never forget that service Brother Williams run over to the right side of the building and he jerked his handkerchief out and he popped it like that toward the congregation and everybody on that side of the building went back into their seat just that quick and then he ran around the pulpit and the other side they were standing and he'd done the same thing and everybody fell into their seats over there.

      "From main 5, I'm Ryan Gavin. It's Friday, June 5th today and this is One Minute Main. The Portland Press Herald, Maine's largest newspaper, has called for Donald Trump to resign. The editorial board released their opinion today, the day the president is set to visit Puritan manufacturing, the maker of those medical swabs, used in coronavirus testing. The Portland Sea Dogs announced today that they've ended their relationship with Shane's of Maine after controversial Facebook posts have accused the owner, Jeff Shane, of using racial slurs with his employees and other unacceptable behaviors in the workplace. The Sea Dogs are currently looking for a new ice cream vendor. Scary story today from the main CDC that has nothing to do with coronavirus, they're warning of possible exposure to acute hepatitis A at the sea salt lobster restaurant in Socko. If you were a patron there recently, you should contact Maine CDC. More than 700 people rallied in Lewiston last night. There are more protests expected for Portland, Bangor, Biddeford, Lewiston and Brunswick this evening. And some good news though, food trucks are finally returning to the waterfront in Bangor, and the Portland Sea Dogs, other than ice cream, are now offering some of their treats curbside as well.
