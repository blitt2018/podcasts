Before you listen to the episode\" go ahead and follow us on all our socials and subscribe to the podcast. [MUSIC] All right\" hello and welcome to another episode of Hypotheticales. I remember the name this time\" so kudos to me. This is going to be a little bit of an interesting episode\" a little bit of a different episode because it's me asking the questions and you don't get to hear my hilarious answers instead you have to hear these shitty answers. So\" yeah\" fun with that. My name is Peter and this is Justin and Matt. Justin. Hello. And Matt. Yes\" hello. How are you guys doing? How's your long weekend doing? It's Victoria Day here in Canada. So\" you know\" it's just another holiday for us\" so we're enjoying it. What have you guys been up to this weekend? Oh\" just staring into the abyss. I mean\" I don't know how to properly celebrate a weekend when every single day has essentially been a copy paste of the previous day\" minus an extra fucking step towards my own death\" but pretty much otherwise everything's okay. I didn't do anything for like the holiday weekend. I mean\" frankly\" there's nothing to do. I mean\" I'm going to go out and\" I mean\" nothing. Nothing happened. I essentially\" I ate french fries. That's the fucking exciting moment of my day of this entire weekend was I ate french fries. That was pretty good. Yeah. What about you\" Justin? I tried to enjoy the sunshine on Saturday. It was the only nice day of the weekend. So\" sat outside and drank some beer and\" you know\" tried to enjoy it and then just been kind of stuck inside now that it's raining for the next three or four days. And longingly looked ahead to the weather for next week\" hoping that the weather man is right because it's supposed to be a beauty. But other than that\" not much. I mean\" kind of to harp back to what Matt was saying\" living in these strange times in quarantine. Every day is sort of a repeat of the previous ones. So\" it's kind of the weekends and the weekdays all kind of blend together into this one sort of\" you know\" melted form of a day. So\" it's just a matter of trying to look at the positives. Yeah. And I guess one of the positives is it's another episode of Hypothetical's today. That is a positive. My favorite part of the week\" Mondays. Yes. So\" without further ado\" we will give you your question. Again\" Matt and Justin are\" yeah\" Matt and Justin. Yeah. I was going to say Peter and Justin. I was like\" wait a second. I'm Peter. Matt and Justin have had no prior knowledge of what question\n"

      "<strong>Description:</strong><br>Sermons from Hope Church in Dubuque, Iowa.<br><br><strong>Transcript:</strong><br>Hey, it's great to see you here today, even though I really can't see you, hopefully you can see me. But hey, we're gonna be continuing our series on Jonah. And Matt, last week Matt kind of started out the series. And as he ended it, he ended where I'm gonna be picking up where Jonah's on the ship and he's gonna get thrown off. And Matt ended it by talking about the title of, \"Dump the Chump,.\" But I figured I would go with a little more Greek title and call it\"\" \"You can run, but you can't hide,.\" And so when we think about what's going on here, the background that's going on is, Jonah has been called by God to go to Nineveh. And he's been called to go to Nineveh and to preach to these people. These people are evil people. People in Israel really did not like the Ninevehites. The Israelites really didn't like the Ninevehites at all. They were just evil people that they didn't wanna be around. And as Jonah is called by God, God says\"\" \"I want you to go to Nineveh,.\" And so what we find out is that Jonah goes down and he gets on a ship and he starts ahead to Tarsus. So I wanna show you what this looks like. Jonah is here. He's in Japa and God calls him to go to Nineveh, about 500 miles. So what Jonah decides to do is I'm gonna get in a ship and I'm gonna go to Tarsus. So it's not like he says, I'm gonna go out and go to the next town or the next city. He says\"\" \"I'm gonna go 2,500 miles away,.\" So God says\"\" \"I want you to go to Nineveh, 500 miles this way,.\"...\n",
      "<strong>Description:</strong><br>Sermons from Hope Church in Dubuque, Iowa.<br><br><strong>Transcript:</strong><br>Hey, welcome. I hope your week went well. So he was a fugitive. He was accused of murdering his wife. He escaped from the law and the U.S. Marshals were after him. And every week we tuned in to see whether he would get apprehended or whether he would get away. And of course, I'm talking about the TV series, The Fugitive. The TV series was filmed in 1967, and then a film came out, I think Harrison Ford was in it, in 1995. But I always wondered, is he going to get caught? Is Robert, Dr. Robert Kimball going to get caught this week? And each week you kept wondering, how is he going to get away? And will he ever get his name exonerated? This weekend we're going to look at another fugitive. He's not running from U.S. Marshals, he's actually running from God. And it's a prophet from the Old Testament, his name is Jonah. And you could turn in your Bibles to Jonah, we're going to talk about Jonah. I just want to address a few things right up front about the book of Jonah. Many people, critics, especially of the Bible, say, well Jonah's a whale of a tail, right? It's a fictitious story, it's make believe, it's good to tell children, but ultimately we can't believe in it. And ultimately the root of that issue is unbelief. The root of that issue is the person and many people do struggle with the idea of miracles. But here's the thing, if you believe in the existence of God and you believe that God, the miracle of creation, if you believe in the resurrection of Jesus Christ, then any other miracle is not really a big problem when you think about it. If you can get...\n",
      "<strong>Description:</strong><br>Sermons from Hope Church in Dubuque, Iowa.<br><br><strong>Transcript:</strong><br>Hey Pastor Matt here. Glad you joined us. I guess my wife's been calling me a little bit shaggy and maybe you're having the same experience in your home. I hope your week went well. I hope that you're enjoying the weather that we're getting. It's a little bit warmer. You're able to get out, get in the yard. I hope you're able to do that. That helps a lot, doesn't it? Hey, we've been talking in this series about five words that can really transform your relationships. And this is going to close that series off. And we're going to look at the last word. And the last word, the one we want to look at this weekend, is yes. Now, we're going to go to a passage in Corinthians, 2 Corinthians, and Paul had this kind of difficult relationship with the church at Corinth. They accused him of being wishy washy, and they challenged him. And Paul wrote a number of letters. We have two of the letters that Paul wrote, but he wrote more than that. And so they basically said, Paul, you're kind of wishy washy. You know you say yes, but then you go back on your word. And Paul writes to defend himself in 2 Corinthians, chapter 1, starting at verse-- well, it's early, verse 16 or so. Now, what we want to do is I want to read, starting at verse 18. So I'm in 2 Corinthians, chapter 1, verse 18. Let me start reading, and then I'll tell you, because this is really an interesting passage. Here's what Paul says., \"The Son of God, Jesus Christ, who has preached among you, by us, by me and Silas, and Timothy was not yes and no. But in him, it has always been yes....\n",

Welcome to Big Valley Grace Community Church here on the Modesto campus in the worship center in the venue. Welcome to everyone who is with us in our online campus. We're glad to be together. You know, over these past 12 weeks, my family, they've been doing church in the backyard. And so, family, I hope you're having fun in the backyard right now, okay? And it's good to be together. We're in a series called Breakthrough. And Wednesday night, Pastor Lonnie is going to finish up this series in our Wednesday night Bible study at 7 p.m. And so, you're going to want to make sure that you're watching online Wednesday night at 7. It's going to be a really great message from Pastor Lonnie. Today, we're going to be in Daniel chapter 3, would encourage you to turn there. I don't know if you sensed during this season that you have felt under attack. It might be that all that's going on with the COVID-19 has caused you to feel under attack. It may be that there is something going on in a relationship that you have that has caused you to feel under attack. There might be something happening in your health that has caused you to feel under attack. My hope would be that as we spend time in the scriptures that this passage that it would speak to you that Jesus Christ is here for you and that Jesus Christ is the breakthrough that you need. You see, the context of Daniel chapter 3, when you consider what happens in chapter 1, the very first verse, it says that Jerusalem was captured, that King Nebuchadnezzar and his army came and captured Jerusalem and they took the tribe of Judah and they exiled them to...\n",

Welcome to Big Valley Grace Community Church to our online campus. And we're glad that we have this ability to be together. And what a week. What a week this is. What a week this has been to be a Christian, to be a follower of Jesus Christ, to claim allegiance to Jesus Christ as both our Lord and our Savior. And in just a moment I'm going to maybe walk through what this week has kind of been from my perspective. But before we do that, I want to encourage you to take your Bible and turn to Romans chapter 13. We're going to be looking at verses one through seven together. And you can also turn to 1 Peter chapter two. We're going to be looking at verses 13 through 17 together. And I would encourage you to go ahead and get your Bible and go to those places and look at those verses where we'll be there in just a second. But before we look at those passages, I came across this verse this last week and I thought, what an incredibly appropriate verse for this moment that we're living in. It's Psalm 122 verse one. It says, I was glad. I was glad when they said to me, let us go to the house of the Lord. I was glad when they said to me, let us go, let us go to the house of the Lord. And I thought, wow, what a, what an encouraging thought even for us right now. But the context of this verse, the context of it, it's a song of a sense. It's of David. So this was a song that they would sing as they ascended to the temple of Mount in Jerusalem, the city of God. And...\n",

You believe that God wants to do a breakthrough in some area of your life and we're believing God is going to use this series. So, everybody go to Romans chapter 8 and look at verse 31. Now Paul's going to do something really, really unique in this little section of Scripture. He poses a number of questions. They're rhetorical questions. These questions, in my opinion, give us a real clear description of what the grace of God is all about. And we're going to talk more about that in a little bit. So, you got your Bibles, Romans chapter 8. It's also going to come up on your screen. Look at verse 31. Paul writes\"\" \"If God is for us, who can be against us? He who do not spare his own son but gave him up for us all. How will he not also, along with him, graciously give us all things? Who will bring any charge against those whom God has chosen? It is God who justifies. Who is it that condemns? Jesus Christ who died more than that who was raised to life and is now at the right hand of God and is also interceding for us. Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? Shall trouble or hardship or persecution or famine or nakedness or danger or the sword? As it is written for your sake we face death all day...\n",

She writes broadly about international relations theory, memory, politics, human rights, transition justice, international ethics, state identity, and politics of the Western Balkans. Her first book that I actually extensively drew on during my PhD was called Hijic, or is called Hijic Justice, Dealing with the Past in the Balkans. It was published in 2009, and examined the contested way in which international norms of transitional justice were appropriated by domestic elites, basically Hijic, by domestic elites across the Western Balkans in the 1990s and 2000s. She's a recipient of a number of research grants and awards, and her latest book about which we're going to hear as well a little bit, Yellow Star, Red Star, Holocaust Remembrance after Communism that was published in 2009. Just recently won the Joseph Roadchild Prize in Nationalism and Ethnic Studies. Congratulations. And so her presentation today will be a reflection on the book with the title Hegemonic Narratives of Holocaust Remembrance in Post-Communics Eastern Europe. Yelena, thank you so much for joining us. I know it's morning for you. You're in Atlanta, so good morning. Welcome. The floor is yours. Thank you. Thank you for organizing this. I'm really sorry that we're not all together. This is a poor substitute, but we'll do our best. So what I'm going to do is try to share my screen, because I have some images to show you as I go through it. And then I will talk a little bit about the images, and then we'll hopefully have a few minutes for Q&A at the end. So let me try to figure out how to do this. OK, so share...\n",

Today we organized with my colleague Johanna Vis. My name is Jessie Barton Renishova and I'm a postdoctoral research fellow at the Oxford department of international development. My main area of focus is transitional justice memory and I have a regional expertise in southeast Europe. My colleague Johanna is a postdoctoral fellow at Max Planck Institute and the Czech Academy of Sciences and she mainly focuses on the dynamic relationship between collective identity and cultural collective memory especially in Central Europe. I've really warmly wanted to welcome you all to our session which is going to be very long. We have two sessions today morning and afternoon with very distinguished speakers and we're very, very pleased that a lot of them have joined us from all over the world. I suppose that is the upside of the current crisis that we are actually able to invite speakers from Australia, the United States without any additional cost apart from sometimes timing issues. Our aim today is to study the socio-political aspects of memory especially how there is dominant or so-called hegemonic narratives are used and misused at the international, national and local levels. I think we've all seen that interpretations of memory have resurfaced again as an important resource both for political actors as well as a mobilization resource for that is being used in the public sphere. Today we will discuss various cases from Northern Ireland, Central Europe, all the way to Brazil as well as Afghanistan, which we will hear about a little bit more in the in the next session. Just a few housekeeping rules for today and just to help you with the organization. All of...\n",

It is to discuss and describe and analyze the dynamics between the hegemonic memories and the countel memories using the case of the local memory of the Polish city of Rotslau. This is based on study, actually on two studies, one I did in 2014-2015 with my colleagues in Rotslau and on the second study that I started just this year, which is a follow-up of the previous one aimed to investigate how this dynamics is ongoing, how the local memories are influenced by this nationalist conservative pan on the national level of politics in Poland. So this is this kind of stages in developing of hegemonic memories and countel narratives that they want to present. I would also like to...\n",

Now we're going to be talking about success, what it means, what it looks like, what are the characteristics that people are successful. Before we do that, man, let's do our news and updates. There's a whole lot of things to talk about. As usual, it seems like the news cycle is just so crazy over the last few years and how quickly things are moving. One thing that's moving quickly is this week, we should cross over the 100,000 deaths in the United States from coronavirus. So not a milestone we're particularly proud of, necessarily, but it's definitely something pretty wild. Yeah. Even from a country that is totally freaked out over a thousand deaths, they really can't wrap their head around. Obviously, the news gets down here about the numbers that we're hitting.
