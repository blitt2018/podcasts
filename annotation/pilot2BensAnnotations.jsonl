Anton Chekhov has a way of disabusing us of our specialness, of making us realize that our problems are, in fact, just like everyone else's. We know the verb, \"abuse\"\" as a word meaning, \"to misuse, to mistreat, or to revile,.\" But when disabuse first appeared in the early 17th century, there was a sense of, \"abuse\"\" now obsolete that meant, \"to deceive,.\" Sir Francis Bacon used that sense, for example, when he wrote in 1605\"\" \"You are much abused if you think your virtue can withstand the king's power,.\" The prefix, \"dis\"\" has the sense of undoing the effect of a verb, so it's not surprising that disabuse means, \"to undecieve,.\" English speakers didn't come up with the idea of joining, \"dis\"\" to, \"abuse\"\" all on their own, however.
