[MUS</font><font color = \"#000000\">IC PLAYING] Good</font><font color = \"#4daf4a\"> afternoon and welcome to a very special edition of Other Ground Live, as we do, well, not really a fight companion, but a companion of some sorts. How you doing,</font><font color = \"#000000\"> Ryan?</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\"> You know, this should be an interesting one.</font><font color = \"#000000\"> [LA</font><font color = \"#4daf4a\">UGHTER] Yeah, I see the OG chat armies slowly forming up in the chat box. We\\'re at a different time today, so I assume it\\'s going to throw some people off. We are going to be watching a live feed of superhuman, which I just turned them on right now. Let me turn off the sound. I don\\'t need to hear them go for the entire hour. For those that are not aware, Ryan want you to describe what superhuman</font><font color = \"#999999\"> is</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\">. So superhuman is this guy that jumps off things into ridiculous</font><font color = \"#999999\"> things</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\">. So pretty much this is a guy that, apparently, has always been a professional wrestling fan, so he\\'ll dive off of an elevated position and do an elbow drop into a</font><font color = \"#999999\"> microwave</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\">. And it\\'s fucking wonderful</font><font color = \"#000000\">. [</font><font color = \"#4daf4a\">LAUGHTER] OK, well, now we have an official timer on it, seven minutes and 36 seconds until show time. So apparently the four o\\'clock thing was a lie. It\\'s a 403 motherfucker. No one can tell the truth anymore. Fine, he\\'s got us for an extra 10 minutes. So how you feeling after the show last</font><font color = \"#999999\"> night</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\">? Oh, fine. I slept in</font><font color = \"#000000\">.</font><font color = \"#4daf4a\"> Oh, yeah. Yeah, I wasn\\'t able to. My dog jumped on my face at like 7.30 in the morning, and that was the end of me sleeping in. But that wasn\\'t too bad. I felt like I fell asleep at like a one or 130. So I was in bed for five and a half, six hours. And God damn, does my fucking tongue hurt, dude. I\\'m having trouble speaking now. I don\\'t know if you\\'ve noticed or not. But yesterday, talking for six hours did not do me any good. I\\'ll be very happy to be going to</font><font color = \"#000000\"> the dentist</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\"> tomorrow. It really shouldn\\'t be like that big of a deal. Like, god</font><font color = \"#000000\"> damn, pal</font><font color = \"#4daf4a\">. Well, my teeth are all weird and fucked up anyways. And it\\'s fell off in such a way that basically there\\'s just like a hook,</font><font color = \"#000000\"> an</font><font color = \"#4daf4a\"> overhook on the tooth now. So whenever my tongue moves up and down, it hits the hook of the</font><font color = \"#999999\"> tooth</font><font color = \"#4daf4a\">. And now it\\'s starting-- and since it\\'s been doing this, so much my tongue is actually starting to swell up. So I\\'m starting to sound just a little bit like super human</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\">. You are just a mealy mouth son of a</font><font color = \"#999999\"> bitch. Well--</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\"> I don\\'t know how these things happen</font><font color = \"#4daf4a\">.</font><font color = \"#999999\"> Yeah, well-- And my</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\"> tongue doesn\\'t overlap all my</font><font color = \"#999999\"> tongue</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\"> or all of my teeth. Like</font><font color = \"#000000\">, I</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\"> don\\'t know what\\'s going on with</font><font color = \"#4daf4a\"> you. Oh, well, that was part of my initial issue was that-- my teeth were originally also fucked up as I have a very narrow jaw. So the teeth didn\\'t have room to spread out and they got all crowded together and shut like that. So it doesn\\'t surprise me that my tongue is hitting this tooth now that it\\'s not a smooth thing to</font><font color = \"#000000\"> go over</font><font color = \"#4daf4a\">. But it is what it is. Hopefully they\\'ll be able to fix it tomorrow. And I won\\'t have one less thing to complain about. So</font><font color = \"#999999\"> what do you think</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\">-- Which takes your list down to what, like, 7,000 things</font><font color = \"#4daf4a\">? Yeah, about 642, but who\\'s keeping track, really. So what do you think it was</font><font color = \"#000000\"> last</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\"> night? That was absolutely the worst performance I\\'ve ever seen from Tyran Wood</font><font color = \"#999999\">ley</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\">. In \"Homelander,\" it doesn\\'t matter if you called the Gilbert Birds win because you didn\\'t show up.</font><font color = \"#000000\"> [</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\">LA</font><font color = \"#999999\">UGH</font><font color = \"#4daf4a\">TER</font><font color = \"#000000\">]</font><font color = \"#999999\"> So yeah. The</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\"> onion means jack</font><font color = \"#4daf4a\"> shit. Yeah. Well, I\\'ll accept for him saying Woodley sucks. That seems pretty accurate. Man, that just changed. Well, yeah, what a big change. I guess not, really. I mean, what a big change from before he won the title. I guess some people-- I don\\'t know if it\\'s the case of not being able to handle the pressure, which I doubt because you don\\'t really get to that point level of MMA without being able to handle pressure, or just basically too fearful of the consequences of losing at</font><font color = \"#000000\"> that</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\"> point. He never opened</font><font color = \"#999999\"> up</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\">. Even in the fifth, when he absolutely needed a</font><font color = \"#999999\"> knockout</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\">, he would throw one shot and wait another minute. Throw another</font><font color = \"#999999\"> shot</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\">. Wait a</font><font color = \"#999999\"> minute</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\">. It wasn\\'t even throwing hard combinations. He was just winging that right hand, and that\\'s about all</font><font color = \"#000000\"> he</font><font color = \"#4daf4a\"> did. Yeah, yeah. The memes going around are basically saying after he took that hard shot in the first round, he was like, oh, right, I\\'m out of here. That was the end of him for the fight. The other 4 and 1/2 rounds was irrelevant to that point. Burns won that fight in the first half a round, basically</font><font color = \"#000000\">.</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\"> Well, I mean, if that was the case, he had an easy out. He could have just curdled up and waited for the ref to step in</font><font color = \"#000000\">.</font><font color = \"#4daf4a\"> Yeah, but there\\'s always middle ground for that. I don\\'t think he consciously gave up, but I do think subconsciously changed his-- the tone of his fight. God damn it, I thought it turned the sound off. Technically, I owe you a case of beer now. We\\'ve never discussed that. That\\'s a common thing for radio shows or TV shows or shit like that. If your phone\\'s on it, it makes noise while you\\'re recording you, everyone, all the way, everyone</font><font color = \"#000000\"> a case of beer</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\">. Well, that case, I\\'ll take a case of white claw. You can talk up undrizzly and send that some bitch over</font><font color = \"#999999\"> anytime</font><font color = \"#4daf4a\">. Like I couldn\\'t guess</font><font color = \"#000000\"> what</font><font color = \"#4daf4a\"> you</font><font color = \"#999999\"> drink</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\">. Well, it\\'s either that or a bottle of Juris Sevenwood, and that\\'s a little bit more expensive for</font><font color = \"#4daf4a\"> you. Right, right. Home Lenders asking me if I know this guy doing the jump in that shit. No, I don\\'t know where he\\'s from. I don\\'t know if he\\'s from the Detroit area. Believe it or not, there\\'s juggle-os all over the world, apparently, as well as professional wrestlers wannabes, as well as whatever he is. There\\'s lots of types of people around the world, much isn\\'t</font><font color = \"#999999\"> Detroit</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\">. Yeah, but he really looks like he would fit in as a Detroit</font><font color = \"#000000\">er</font><font color = \"#4daf4a\">. I\\'m not saying he wouldn\\'t. People think of Detroit as very urban, very multicultural place, but they also have their fair share of urban rednecks out of column. They\\'re rednecks, but they don\\'t live in the</font><font color = \"#999999\"> country</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\">. Well, yeah, this guy absolutely looks like he should be your neighbor. And you should be there filming for him sitting in your inf</font><font color = \"#999999\">latable</font><font color = \"#4daf4a\"> hot tub. That\\'d be comfy</font><font color = \"#999999\">. Poor standing</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\"> behind him playing bass, but you had actually had to wheel a TV out there so you could</font><font color = \"#000000\"> rock band it</font><font color = \"#4daf4a\">. That would be pretty funny, wouldn\\'t it? So they\\'re showing us clips of previous stunts. Like he just drank an entire bottle of hot sauce. And now he\\'s about to do-- yeah, then he jumped off backwards onto a whole bunch of barbed wire that was propped up on some chairs. And they\\'re just switching the clips to clips. From clips to clips, they\\'re not even doing their whole stunts right now. That\\'s because we only have two minutes until</font><font color = \"#999999\"> show</font><font color = \"#4daf4a\">time. And apparently he\\'s big on the drinking hot sauce thing, because here\\'s yet another clip of him</font><font color = \"#999999\"> drinking a whole bunch of</font><font color = \"#4daf4a\"> hot sauce</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\">. Yeah, he has a lot of go-</font><font color = \"#000000\">t</font><font color = \"#4daf4a\">os.</font><font color = \"#999999\"> Yeah</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\">. Is that he has the barbed wire, the toy cars</font><font color = \"#999999\">.</font><font color = \"#999999\"> He doesn\\'t</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\"> love the same</font><font color = \"#4daf4a\"> shit. Right, right. Now he just jumped onto the thumbtacks. He is wearing a helmet on this in the next clip, which is, I think, an improvement. I certainly don\\'t think he should be taking any more damage to his noggin. So right now he\\'s on like-- What do you call that, right? Is that a scooter?</font><font color = \"#999999\"> A</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\"> razor sc</font><font color = \"#999999\">ooter</font><font color = \"#4daf4a\">? A razor scooter, yeah. And he\\'s zipping around towards nothing good, I imagine.</font><font color = \"#999999\"> Yeah</font><font color = \"#4daf4a\">, right into the-- that only wasn\\'t that impressive. I don\\'t know if he was aiming for a tree, a mist, or what. Or if</font><font color = \"#999999\"> that\\'s mostly poison ivy. Yeah,</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\"> that was some weak shit right</font><font color = \"#999999\"> there</font><font color = \"#4daf4a\">. Yeah, it might have</font><font color = \"#999999\"> been poison ivy.</font><font color = \"#4daf4a\"> You don\\'t know,</font><font color = \"#999999\"> right</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\">? But home letter, absolutely. I would love to have 200,000 YouTube followers.</font><font color = \"#000000\"> I</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\">\\'m</font><font color = \"#999999\"> just not</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\"> going to jump off anything to get it</font><font color = \"#999999\">. Yeah, exactly. This</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\"> way</font><font color = \"#000000\">, I</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\"> see Mike has less followers than this guy. And all this guy does is just jump through</font><font color = \"#999999\"> shit</font><font color = \"#4daf4a\">. Yeah, and from what I understand, not to speak about other people\\'s business, but he posted it on the OG. His YouTube channel was basically supporting him while his gym was closed. So with the amount of followers he had, doesn\\'t he have like 20,000 or 30,000 or something like that, he was making it enough to pay the bills. This guy\\'s super human guy. He\\'s probably making a fair amount of</font><font color = \"#000000\"> cash from</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\"> this. Well, maybe yes and maybe no. So the problem with him is even with him monetizing his channel</font><font color = \"#000000\">,</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\"> like number one, his videos are like less than a minute long</font><font color = \"#377eb8\"> and they</font><font color = \"#999999\">\\'re not</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\"> advertiser friendly.</font><font color = \"#000000\"> Right, right,</font><font color = \"#999999\"> right.</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\"> If you look, if you\\'re looking like per view pay, like I see Mike\\'s probably doing way better than this dude.</font><font color = \"#000000\"> Right</font><font color = \"#4daf4a\">, right. When I say, you know, making a fair amount of money, I think like this guy\\'s, it\\'s entirely possible. He supports himself versus a YouTube channel making 40 or 50 or 60,000 a year, which can, you know, which is horrible when you think about what he\\'s doing to his body. But on the other hand, there\\'s not a lot of 40 or 50 or $60,000 jobs out there for this gentleman. So I\\'m good for him for finding something that actually pays him enough to support himself and do what he obviously loves to do. You know, he\\'s having more fun at his job than I am at mine most of the time. I</font><font color = \"#999999\"> will</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\"> give him a very, you know</font><font color = \"#999999\">,</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\"> well wished</font><font color = \"#000000\">.</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\"> Whoop</font><font color = \"#999999\">,</font><font color = \"#4daf4a\"> whoop. OK, apparently we are alive with some really, really choppy video. Jesus</font><font color = \"#999999\"> Christ</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\">, can he not afford like a good internet connection?</font><font color = \"#000000\"> I</font><font color = \"#4daf4a\"> don\\'t know. Do you think it\\'s the internet? Yeah, I don\\'t know. This looks this looks like a webcam from like 19 from 2002. Yeah, where it\\'s kicking along at like 15 frames per minute, per second rather.</font><font color = \"#999999\"> Oh</font><font color = \"#999999\">,</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\"> no, this might be 15 frames per per minute.</font><font color = \"#4daf4a\"> Yeah. OK, for those not able to watch live, he has some sort of platform set up next to a trampoline. I thought I saw a kiddie pool. I don\\'t have the sound on because I don\\'t think I can handle it. So they switch over to two idiots that I don\\'t know who are. Brian, do you have your sound on? I</font><font color = \"#000000\"> have</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\"> it very, very low so it doesn\\'t take over the YouTube feed. But yeah, so I guess the guy on the right is Kevin Gill. I think he\\'s a podcaster, I guess. The</font><font color = \"#000000\"> guy</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\"> on the left is Joey Janella, who\\'s a professional wrestler.</font><font color = \"#000000\"> And</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\"> then obviously on the far left is the feed to the super human compound. Right</font><font color = \"#4daf4a\">. I think on the top right is just like a graphic. They have no way of a burning microwave. So is are you able to put this through to our YouTube feed? So are people are going to be able to watch the YouTube channel of superhuman while they\\'re listening to us or they\\'re going to have to like do that themselves? They</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\">\\'re going to have to do it themselves. I was trying to get it on there earlier and it just I was having some technical difficulty with it.</font><font color = \"#000000\"> It might not</font><font color = \"#4daf4a\"> be certain you can do. You might not be able to sign your client, cast someone else\\'s live feed.</font><font color = \"#000000\"> Well, no, it</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\"> would just be like a window caption doing it that way, but</font><font color = \"#999999\"> my enjoy. Yes, like</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\"> just isn\\'t liking that idea right now. Right</font><font color = \"#4daf4a\">. Oh</font><font color = \"#000000\">, well, that</font><font color = \"#4daf4a\">\\'s all right. You know, we just gentlemen needs his views anyway. So it\\'s probably the</font><font color = \"#999999\"> best.</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\"> Even if it is a no, no, you think that super human is smart enough to actually sue somebody.</font><font color = \"#000000\"> Yeah, maybe</font><font color = \"#4daf4a\"> not. But he might know people. I mean, I don\\'t think he probably set up most of the stuff up himself anyways. OK</font><font color = \"#999999\">,</font><font color = \"#4daf4a\"> now they\\'re doing the very first, uh,</font><font color = \"#000000\"> oh</font><font color = \"#4daf4a\">, superhuman versus a thousand thumbtacks. Oh, sorry, 10,</font><font color = \"#999999\">000. That\\'s</font><font color = \"#4daf4a\"> way more than a thousand. I mean, so what made all these graphics for a shit? And</font><font color = \"#000000\">. Well, yeah,</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\"> I got a bunch of graphics made for us and that that was just me just wasting like 30 bucks.</font><font color = \"#999999\"> But</font><font color = \"#4daf4a\"> yeah</font><font color = \"#999999\">,</font><font color = \"#4daf4a\"> I mean, you know, at least he didn\\'t put the effort into it. And I guess he\\'s listening all the shit he does on his graphic. I, as I mentioned, I don\\'t have to sound down. So a lot of this is lost in me. I\\'m just waiting for his edit. Oh, fucking. Yes, it\\'s a Colton dong. I don\\'t know what that means, but I\\'m really, really the anticipation. Anticipation is really building at this point. What</font><font color = \"#000000\"> the fuck</font><font color = \"#999999\"> is</font><font color = \"#999999\"> he</font><font color = \"#999999\"> doing</font><font color = \"#4daf4a\">?</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\"> Oh, he\\'s putting a bunch of thumbtacks strips onto a</font><font color = \"#999999\"> what</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\"> looks like might be some sheet rock.</font><font color = \"#999999\"> No</font><font color = \"#999999\">, I</font><font color = \"#4daf4a\"> think that\\'s, I think that\\'s half a door. You see the paneling</font><font color = \"#000000\">? Oh</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\">, yeah. Right. That is one of those super cheap fucking particle board doors.</font><font color = \"#999999\"> Oh</font><font color = \"#4daf4a\">, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. The one the rampage doesn\\'t like all. Yeah</font><font color = \"#999999\">. The</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\"> infamous ultimate fighter doors that, you know, you can break down with a, with a strong breath.</font><font color = \"#000000\"> That</font><font color = \"#4daf4a\"> was pretty, it was pretty funny. You know, when Deans saw that, he\\'s like, well, shit, how shitty are doors or something like that? Yeah. Yeah, that was pretty funny. I mean, it was impressive at first until you realize that, you know,</font><font color = \"#999999\"> that</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\"> it was basically made out of cardboard. Like</font><font color = \"#999999\">, yeah, yeah. Those</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\"> doors were pathetic.</font><font color = \"#000000\"> Yeah,</font><font color = \"#4daf4a\"> yeah, exactly.</font><font color = \"#999999\"> Thousands</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\"> and thousands of dollars of equipment and a full cage set up.</font><font color = \"#999999\"> And</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\"> you have like a $7 fucking door. Come on</font><font color = \"#999999\">.</font><font color = \"#999999\"> Yeah</font><font color = \"#4daf4a\">. You know, it was so easy. Made something that should have been impressive. That rampage did look, looked stupid.</font><font color = \"#999999\"> Oh</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\">, he\\'s going into a spiel. I have to turn it up a little bit on the YouTube here</font><font color = \"#000000\">.</font><font color = \"#999999\"> I</font><font color = \"#999999\"> have</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\"> to</font><font color = \"#000000\"> turn up a</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\"> bus. Oh, we got the whoop whoop.</font><font color = \"#000000\"> He\\'s about</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\"> to tar it up into his fuck this shit.</font><font color = \"#4daf4a\"> Oh, oh, oh, yeah. I had to turn the sound on head a little bit</font><font color = \"#000000\">. Oh</font><font color = \"#4daf4a\">, oh</font><font color = \"#999999\">,</font><font color = \"#4daf4a\"> yeah</font><font color = \"#999999\">.</font><font color = \"#377eb8\"> Oh</font><font color = \"#000000\">, Jesus. Oh</font><font color = \"#4daf4a\">, so</font><font color = \"#999999\"> these</font><font color = \"#4daf4a\"> guys are doing commentary. I didn\\'t realize that.</font><font color = \"#377eb8\"> Yeah</font><font color = \"#999999\">.</font><font color = \"#000000\"> Oh</font><font color = \"#4daf4a\">, horrible commentary on my dad. I think ours is way better.</font><font color = \"#000000\"> It looks like</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\"> he might be bleeding a little bit.</font><font color = \"#4daf4a\"> Yeah.</font><font color = \"#999999\"> Okay</font><font color = \"#4daf4a\">. I have to turn off the sound in between the jumps. I can\\'t handle the commentators. Yeah, he\\'s jumped on the thumbtacks. He\\'s got he\\'s bleeding a little bit from the back. And it</font><font color = \"#000000\"> was like</font><font color = \"#4daf4a\"> a happy camper, but I\\'m sure he\\'s going to move on because he\\'s a trooper. My</font><font color = \"#984ea3\"> God.</font><font color = \"#999999\"> This</font><font color = \"#984ea3\"> is. I</font><font color = \"#000000\"> am, you</font><font color = \"#4daf4a\"> know, I\\'m so embarrassed that I\\'m watching this. I\\'ll be honest with you. It\\'s it\\'s not a it\\'s not a it\\'s not a high point for me. It\\'s like watching</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\"> a car wreck, though. You can\\'t look away.</font><font color = \"#999999\"> Yeah</font><font color = \"#4daf4a\">, no, no, I don\\'t fucking I\\'m not going anywhere. I\\'ve got half of a piece of meat there with some rice that\\'s getting cold because I wasn\\'t able to finish it before we started the show, but I\\'m sure it\\'s fucking not going to stop now. I</font><font color = \"#999999\"> mean</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\">, you</font><font color = \"#999999\"> like</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\"> you can\\'t say that we\\'re, you know, like exploiting this or anything. Honestly, he does have 20,000 times more followers than we do.</font><font color = \"#999999\"> Right</font><font color = \"#4daf4a\">. Right. Exactly. And apparently us, you know, apparently I should have did a little more advertising today that we moved the show because the live audiences, not what we thought it was going to be. So live</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\"> audience, Oh, Blender.</font><font color = \"#999999\"> Oh</font><font color = \"#4daf4a\">, right. All right. Who who\\'s never seen such a skinny fat piece of shit. Yeah, dude, he is, you know, definitely for</font><font color = \"#999999\"> someone</font><font color = \"#4daf4a\"> who seems like he\\'s an active fellow.</font><font color = \"#999999\"> You</font><font color = \"#4daf4a\"> know, I</font><font color = \"#999999\"> don\\'t really know. If</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\"> you consider it just active jumping off things</font><font color = \"#999999\">,</font><font color = \"#4daf4a\"> like, well</font><font color = \"#999999\">, you know, you\\'ve never</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\"> seen them on a like a treadmill.</font><font color = \"#999999\"> You</font><font color = \"#4daf4a\"> could climb up there first. I mean, you know</font><font color = \"#000000\">, what</font><font color = \"#4daf4a\"> the fuck is this? OK, I get to know something back on Kermit, the extreme stunt frog. Oh,</font><font color = \"#000000\"> yeah</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\">, that seems pretty cringy. Guy</font><font color = \"#000000\">, that\\'s a horrible Kermit, the frog</font><font color = \"#4daf4a\"> impersonation. Is</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\"> it? Yeah, I couldn\\'t hear it. So. OK</font><font color = \"#4daf4a\">, then now they\\'re doing even a horrible OK, I got to turn this off. I will point out the fact that he has had like 20 or $30,000 donated to him so far.</font><font color = \"#999999\"> That</font><font color = \"#4daf4a\">\\'s I saw this on his video page earlier, like he kept him saying hit in the 10,000 thumbtack level, the 20,000 thumbtack level. And he was talking about like one thumbtack for each dollar donated. So so I know I saw with us at 30,000 thumbtack level. So people have sent this guy $30,000, at least so far to do the stunts that he\\'s doing today. Well</font><font color = \"#000000\">, God</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\"> damn, Jay, like, why are you going to start jumping into things? I</font><font color = \"#4daf4a\"> think I might have hit my window of I missed my window of opportunity for that, actually, you would have caught me in my 20s. I might have tried some of that shit. But now, no, I don\\'t think, you know, if nothing else, I don\\'t think I can make enough money to cover the medical deductibles. Yeah</font><font color = \"#000000\">, you</font><font color = \"#4daf4a\"> are</font><font color = \"#999999\"> little</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\"> brittle for this sort of thing.</font><font color = \"#999999\"> Yeah</font><font color = \"#4daf4a\">. All</font><font color = \"#999999\"> right</font><font color = \"#4daf4a\">. So, boy, I like I said, I just turned it on back off most of the time because I can\\'t handle these guys at all. So you\\'ll have to let me know if they\\'re seeing something pertinent. It looks like they\\'re showing the next stunt something to do with a kiddie pool, two buckets filled with thumbtacks. And got a lot of thumbtacks. And</font><font color = \"#000000\"> what</font><font color = \"#4daf4a\"> was the opposite side? Was that more tax trips? No, no, no, those are. Oh my God, those are fluorescent light tubes. So there\\'s apparently a lot going on with that.</font><font color = \"#999999\"> Interesting</font><font color = \"#4daf4a\">.</font><font color = \"#999999\"> Hold</font><font color = \"#4daf4a\"> on. I</font><font color = \"#999999\"> think</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\"> that\\'s actually the main event because it\\'s so like I listed it in the podcast thread. Apparently</font><font color = \"#000000\">, it</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\">\\'s going to be a total of four things. There</font><font color = \"#000000\"> was</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\"> the flying elbow drop into tax strips, which we already saw.</font><font color = \"#999999\"> There</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\"> is a butt buster into flower pots.</font><font color = \"#000000\"> There\\'s</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\"> a smashing of cactus and rat traps with his hand. And</font><font color = \"#000000\"> then</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\"> there\\'s the main event. Oh</font><font color = \"#4daf4a\"> my. And then they will happen with the main event is so that\\'s a pretty good lead up,</font><font color = \"#999999\"> though. Yeah</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\">, I think that\\'s all the tax in the kiddie pool of the gas.</font><font color = \"#999999\"> Right</font><font color = \"#999999\">. Light</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\"> tubes and whatever else. All</font><font color = \"#000000\"> right, that</font><font color = \"#4daf4a\">\\'s not going to be fun at all. Gosh darn dogs. My wife is actually not here. She\\'s been gone once a day, helping family members with issues. I think she\\'s home now or something. At least I hope that</font><font color = \"#999999\">\\'s her.</font><font color = \"#999999\"> Something</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\">\\'s going on.</font><font color = \"#999999\"> You</font><font color = \"#4daf4a\"> know, well, I hope that\\'s her because if it\\'s not, we\\'re going to have to go through this all over again when she actually gets home. Oh,</font><font color = \"#999999\"> Jesus</font><font color = \"#999999\">. That\\'s not acceptable. Yeah, I\\'m</font><font color = \"#4daf4a\"> you. Well,</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\"> goddamn. I don\\'t really have much to say because there\\'s not much going on on this event right now. I</font><font color = \"#000000\">\\'m still</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\"> surprised no one else is here, though. Oh, man, you\\'re your dedication is appreciated here since you failed on us for seven hours last night. See</font><font color = \"#000000\"> if we can figure</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\"> out actually how to add video to the live stream</font><font color = \"#000000\">. And then I oh shit</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\">, you\\'re not here Friday either. God damn pal.</font><font color = \"#4daf4a\"> OK, they stopped for a second. If they go up and they could start up again, you can go and see what their problem is</font><font color = \"#000000\">. Oh,</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\"> they\\'re fine. Let him park.</font><font color = \"#999999\"> All</font><font color = \"#4daf4a\"> right, if it\\'s all this, as long as it\\'s not too bad on the, like, on your side for the audio. It is</font><font color = \"#000000\"> pretty bad</font><font color = \"#4daf4a\">, though, isn\\'t it? I don</font><font color = \"#999999\">\\'t really give</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\"> a shit. Like, honestly, I mean, it\\'s just dark dark and we\\'re watching an idiot jump into things like</font><font color = \"#000000\"> this</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\"> entire thing is the trick show.</font><font color = \"#999999\"> Right</font><font color = \"#4daf4a\">. Exactly. Is he getting ready for his next thing now? Shit, it was our is it already time? Or</font><font color = \"#000000\"> is</font><font color = \"#4daf4a\"> ours, or is it like flashbacks?</font><font color = \"#999999\"> It was like</font><font color = \"#4daf4a\"> how</font><font color = \"#000000\"> this is</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\"> a flashback</font><font color = \"#000000\">. I</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\"> have</font><font color = \"#999999\"> seen you. Oh</font><font color = \"#4daf4a\">,</font><font color = \"#000000\"> OK,</font><font color = \"#4daf4a\"> so he just drank a whole bunch of hot toss then ran in and shouldered a door that was set up against a fence and had a whole bunch of, like, fluorescent light bulbs taped to it. And he broke, he broke the door so good for him. However, he also, like, bloodied up his shoulder pretty bad. Now</font><font color = \"#000000\"> they</font><font color = \"#4daf4a\">\\'re back in the live fever. He\\'s like about to pour a bucket of thumbtacks into the before mentioned kiddie bull</font><font color = \"#000000\">, which they</font><font color = \"#4daf4a\"> did make the, the wise decision of buying a plastic one instead of a blow up one. That\\'s a smart thinking.</font><font color = \"#999999\"> Or</font><font color = \"#4daf4a\"> is that a blow up one?</font><font color = \"#000000\"> Is</font><font color = \"#4daf4a\"> it? I</font><font color = \"#000000\"> can</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\">\\'t really tell.</font><font color = \"#999999\"> You</font><font color = \"#4daf4a\"> know what? I think it is a blow up one. Hmm. That\\'s a, that\\'s a bold strategy, Cotton. See if that plays out. Yeah</font><font color = \"#000000\">, I don\\'t know</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\"> about that choice.</font><font color = \"#000000\"> I</font><font color = \"#4daf4a\"> guess I guess at this point, it\\'s a one use pool. Because I love it. Look, come on, let\\'s be honest. That\\'s the leads at his worries at this point, whether he\\'s going to be able to use the pool again. Yeah,</font><font color = \"#000000\"> that</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\">\\'s a good</font><font color = \"#999999\"> point</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\">.</font><font color = \"#999999\"> Yeah</font><font color = \"#4daf4a\">.</font><font color = \"#999999\"> Apparently</font><font color = \"#4daf4a\">, I don\\'t know those those those thumbtacks aren\\'t going as far as spreading as far as he thought they would, apparently. So he\\'s, he looks kind of concerned</font><font color = \"#000000\">. Yeah,</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\"> he needs to get a nice mound going there.</font><font color = \"#999999\"> Yeah</font><font color = \"#999999\">. Yeah. So center</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\">.</font><font color = \"#999999\"> Right</font><font color = \"#4daf4a\">. Right. Don\\'t worry about even your, you\\'re looking for depth. Yeah. You\\'re not going to hit most of them. You\\'re going to hit that one spot. So make sure you get that spot good. Yeah.</font><font color = \"#000000\"> And those</font><font color = \"#4daf4a\"> two idiots, you know, those are definitely a couple of juggle those I\\'m trying not to look at the pictures of that guy behind that guy in the right. I\\'m sure they\\'re cool people these met before.</font><font color = \"#999999\"> Yeah</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\">. I don\\'t</font><font color = \"#999999\"> see</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\"> anybody really have no there.</font><font color = \"#999999\"> Yeah</font><font color = \"#999999\">. I\\'m not</font><font color = \"#999999\"> surprised</font><font color = \"#4daf4a\">. Oh, shit. What\\'s they got? Oh. So basically there\\'s</font><font color = \"#999999\"> this</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\"> bambalo\\'s</font><font color = \"#4daf4a\"> bamb</font><font color = \"#999999\">alo</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\">\\'s.</font><font color = \"#4daf4a\"> I think there\\'s there\\'s this basic, you know, um, community of people that all</font><font color = \"#999999\"> want</font><font color = \"#4daf4a\"> to be famous. And</font><font color = \"#000000\"> so</font><font color = \"#4daf4a\"> they\\'re doing fucking stupid fucking shit. OK, he\\'s pouring hot sauce in his eyes. Hot sauce in his eyes, ladies and gentlemen. Uh</font><font color = \"#999999\">,</font><font color = \"#4daf4a\"> dude, I\\'m never going to be famous. I\\'m never going to be, you know, an internet sensation. I don\\'t have what it takes clearly. Yeah</font><font color = \"#999999\">.</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\"> I don\\'t even know what to say of that. Like that was just really stupid for no reason. Right</font><font color = \"#4daf4a\">. Well, here\\'s the thing. He\\'s got no dudes got 2,644 people watching this live feed as we speak. Um, he\\'s</font><font color = \"#999999\"> got</font><font color = \"#4daf4a\"> all</font><font color = \"#999999\"> these people of</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\"> them.</font><font color = \"#999999\"> We</font><font color = \"#4daf4a\"> are three of them. He\\'s got, um, dozens</font><font color = \"#000000\"> and</font><font color = \"#4daf4a\"> dozens and dozens of people that are not quite as famous as here, but have their own little following. And they all have this weird synergy going where all they\\'re all together. They\\'re kind of supporting their own cottage industry. It\\'s it\\'s weird fucked up and kind of interesting in a way. It</font><font color = \"#000000\">\\'s</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\"> also just</font><font color = \"#999999\"> terrible</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\">. How</font><font color = \"#999999\"> low</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\"> budget the video quality is for this. I</font><font color = \"#999999\"> know</font><font color = \"#4daf4a\">. I mean, he spent more money on that banner behind him, uh, with a picture of him. Then he did. I\\'m the fucking video camera. Yeah</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\">.</font><font color = \"#999999\"> Ter</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\">rible video camera, terrible internet connection.</font><font color = \"#999999\"> God</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\"> damn pal.</font><font color = \"#999999\"> I\\'m just hoping he</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\">\\'s just dumping hot sauce on the tax. Yeah</font><font color = \"#4daf4a\">. Okay. Well, I don\\'t know. Maybe that would hurt more. I</font><font color = \"#000000\"> don\\'t, I\\'m sure</font><font color = \"#4daf4a\"> it\\'s not going to make it hurt less. So, you know,</font><font color = \"#999999\"> although</font><font color = \"#4daf4a\"> I</font><font color = \"#000000\">\\'ve</font><font color = \"#4daf4a\"> seen him drink so many bottles of hot sauce at this point, I think he\\'d be immune to any kind of, uh</font><font color = \"#999999\">,</font><font color = \"#4daf4a\"> pain at all. Hot sauce, hot sauce related. Yeah</font><font color = \"#000000\">, I\\'m with</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\"> Homelander. This definitely looks like 2006 at the absolute high end.</font><font color = \"#4daf4a\"> Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Um, God, I really, I just really hope it\\'s a problem with the internet connection. And when we go back and rewatch this shit, we\\'ll have high quality HD video. Uh,</font><font color = \"#999999\"> because</font><font color = \"#4daf4a\"> clearly we\\'re going to watch this many, many times over and over again. Well</font><font color = \"#000000\">,</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\"> God damn, we\\'re going to do a weekly watch along of this. Yeah.</font><font color = \"#999999\"> Just</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\"> for our human or superhuman, you know, fix. Yeah</font><font color = \"#4daf4a\">, no kidding. Oh man.</font><font color = \"#000000\"> Did you ever</font><font color = \"#4daf4a\"> know anybody like this growing up?</font><font color = \"#000000\"> Not</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\"> this stupid.</font><font color = \"#000000\"> Yeah, I</font><font color = \"#4daf4a\"> mean, but, uh, no, me neither, but I\\'ve not met quite a few of them that were like stupid enough. I don\\'t know. Maybe, maybe yes, maybe no. Oh, I, this is the coach sports analyst. Um, I have several problems with that. I\\'ll</font><font color = \"#999999\"> look</font><font color = \"#4daf4a\">. Okay. I\\'m going to turn it up. I\\'m</font><font color = \"#999999\"> going</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\"> to use to be on ESPN.</font><font color = \"#000000\"> You</font><font color = \"#4daf4a\">\\'re shooting me really.</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\"> Yeah.</font><font color = \"#000000\"> How the mighty</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\"> a</font><font color = \"#999999\"> problem</font><font color = \"#999999\"> for this</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\">.</font><font color = \"#4daf4a\"> Oh, yeah. Uh</font><font color = \"#000000\">, probably not</font><font color = \"#4daf4a\"> much. You did say he used to be any ESPN. Yeah</font><font color = \"#999999\">,</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\"> this entire thing is a little, little low rent.</font><font color = \"#999999\"> So yeah,</font><font color = \"#4daf4a\"> he</font><font color = \"#999999\"> probably did it for free.</font><font color = \"#4daf4a\"> He probably did it for free for the publicity. Yeah. Hopefully he\\'s hoping it\\'s going to take him back to the top. Yeah</font><font color = \"#000000\">, this is definitely a</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\"> way to launch your career.</font><font color = \"#999999\"></font><font color = \"#4daf4a\"> Oh, man,</font><font color = \"#999999\"> I don</font><font color = \"#4daf4a\">\\'t know. I don\\'t know about this, man. I\\'ve</font><font color = \"#000000\"> got a</font><font color = \"#4daf4a\"> bad feeling about this. I think we\\'re going to watch something fucked up here at a certain point. And we\\'re not going to like it. We\\'re going to leave this show going. Why did we do this? We, I have so many regrets.</font><font color = \"#999999\"> Okay</font><font color = \"#999999\">. There\\'s nobody</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\"> really hurts himself. And I get to hear that like guttural moan where it\\'s not necessarily like, Oh, fuck.</font><font color = \"#999999\"> No</font><font color = \"#984ea3\">, God.</font><font color = \"#999999\"> Not</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\"> that more of the.</font><font color = \"#999999\"> Oh</font><font color = \"#999999\">.</font><font color = \"#000000\"></font><font color = \"#4daf4a\"> That\\'s what we\\'re going for. Uh, that\\'s by the way, it\\'s not fun making that sound. You know, the voluntary pain sound. I\\'m sure we\\'ve all done it a couple of times. And that\\'s not an occasion that you look forward to or ever want to repeat. Yeah</font><font color = \"#999999\">.</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\"> But God damn, is it entertaining to listen to?</font><font color = \"#999999\"> No</font><font color = \"#4daf4a\">, I already bought. Oh, by the way, there\\'s the other half of the door that we saw earlier. At least he\\'s apparently he\\'s on a budget. He can\\'t go around just breaking doors. Willie Nilly. He\\'s</font><font color = \"#999999\"> got</font><font color = \"#999999\"> a place of faith. Yeah</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\">, he\\'s efficient. If</font><font color = \"#999999\"> not</font><font color = \"#999999\">, yeah.</font><font color = \"#4daf4a\"> Yeah. Yeah. Now, and he\\'s going</font><font color = \"#000000\"> to</font><font color = \"#4daf4a\"> break flower pots. I, is there something about, you know, like flower pots that I\\'m unaware of? But like, as far as like their danger level is, uh, I</font><font color = \"#000000\"> mean</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\">, they\\'re just a clay pot. Like, yeah, if you break it wrong, I\\'m sure it can probably jab into your something, but.</font><font color = \"#999999\"> And</font><font color = \"#4daf4a\"> now</font><font color = \"#999999\"> he</font><font color = \"#4daf4a\">\\'s going inside to grab something. Uh,</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\"> oh</font><font color = \"#999999\">, yeah, that</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\">\\'s a, that\\'s a high class porch.</font><font color = \"#999999\"> It</font><font color = \"#4daf4a\">\\'s nicer. My porch, man. Oh, should do you notice that they have a ticker feed in the bottom of how</font><font color = \"#999999\"> much people are fucking giving</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\"> them money? Yeah.</font><font color = \"#999999\"> Yeah</font><font color = \"#4daf4a\">. I</font><font color = \"#999999\"> hope that</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\">\\'s not a Hayden tell for giving him 10 bucks.</font><font color = \"#999999\"> Fuck</font><font color = \"#4daf4a\">. Yeah, Hayden. I hope that\\'s okay. I\\'m from it there. I was afraid it was a live feed of, you know, of the money coming in as we spoke. It\\'s probably the people, the feed of the, of all the</font><font color = \"#999999\"> money he\\'s been given. The last way. He</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\">\\'s got like a sack of shit.</font><font color = \"#4daf4a\"> Are those all their staples? Are those staples? Uh</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\">, yeah, they look like staples. OK,</font><font color = \"#4daf4a\"> and</font><font color = \"#999999\"> then. Oh,</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\"> God, here comes the toy cars</font><font color = \"#999999\">,</font><font color = \"#4daf4a\"> the toy cars. Of course you called it. I didn\\'t think that was a real thing, but apparently it is. It</font><font color = \"#999999\">\\'s</font><font color = \"#999999\"> one</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\"> of his staples.</font><font color = \"#000000\"> See,</font><font color = \"#4daf4a\"> now here\\'s the thing. You want to impress you, bring out some fucking Legos. He</font><font color = \"#999999\">\\'s</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\"> done that</font><font color = \"#000000\">.</font><font color = \"#4daf4a\"> Oh, gee, OK, why? Hey, OK, no, maybe those are just metal grates or some part. Yeah, random pieces of metal he found. I don\\'t know. I don\\'t know what</font><font color = \"#999999\"> those are.</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\"> Yeah, it doesn\\'t help that</font><font color = \"#000000\"> he</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\">\\'s, you know, filming it on a fucking old school Nokia phone.</font><font color = \"#000000\"> OK, I</font><font color = \"#4daf4a\">\\'m turning it up so I want to hear the him land</font><font color = \"#000000\">. OK, apparently they\\'re</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\"> trustless. Oh, I definitely done construction. I just this the quality of this video is just fucking me.</font><font color = \"#999999\"> Yeah</font><font color = \"#377eb8\">.</font><font color = \"#000000\"> He</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\"> does the intro for every single one of them still. Yeah</font><font color = \"#377eb8\">, we</font><font color = \"#999999\"> still</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\"> got a whoop whoop.</font><font color = \"#000000\"> Oh</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\">.</font><font color = \"#000000\"> Oh, OK, he</font><font color = \"#377eb8\"> was</font><font color = \"#999999\"> yelling</font><font color = \"#4daf4a\">. He was yelling when you, but I couldn\\'t understand what he said. What was that one thing that we didn\\'t know what it was?</font><font color = \"#999999\"> Trust</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\"> plates.</font><font color = \"#4daf4a\"> Trust plates, OK. And ladies and gentlemen, he jumped and did a buttbuster on it. And I will I will give him credit. You he he isn\\'t selling it. That\\'s real. Yeah. I don\\'t see how you could like fake that and have it hurt less. Is</font><font color = \"#000000\"> he</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\"> bleeding</font><font color = \"#999999\">?</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\"> Oh, yeah, he\\'s</font><font color = \"#000000\">. You got</font><font color = \"#4daf4a\"> a</font><font color = \"#999999\"> couple of</font><font color = \"#999999\"> his</font><font color = \"#4daf4a\"> fucked up. He\\'s got a couple of few spots. And I don\\'t even want to see his ass because that\\'s probably where the real</font><font color = \"#999999\"> damage</font><font color = \"#4daf4a\"> is because that was pretty much a buttbuster for the last one.</font><font color = \"#999999\"> If</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\"> nothing else, so at least jumping through the door does kind of help break the landing. Oh</font><font color = \"#000000\">, I</font><font color = \"#4daf4a\"> see you\\'re saying, yeah, as opposed to just having it on the ground.</font><font color = \"#999999\"> Right</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\">. Well, that\\'s why, like professional wrestlers, when you see them jump off, like super high stuff, they always go through</font><font color = \"#000000\"> a</font><font color = \"#999999\"> table, right, right, right</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\">, before you hit the ground.</font><font color = \"#999999\"> Right</font><font color = \"#4daf4a\">. At least a little bit. Oh, yeah</font><font color = \"#999999\">,</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\"> you\\'re still not going to catch me dead doing any of that shit.</font><font color = \"#4daf4a\"> Oh, fuck. No, I</font><font color = \"#999999\"> was. Blood</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\"> on the door</font><font color = \"#4daf4a\">. Yeah, I don\\'t know. I was I missed that. I was like, glanced away for a second.</font><font color = \"#000000\"> Yeah</font><font color = \"#4daf4a\">, it</font><font color = \"#999999\"> looks</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\"> like he lost some blood on that door.</font><font color = \"#999999\"> Oh</font><font color = \"#4daf4a\">, hey, he leek him. Yeah, I mean, these these wrestler people, they\\'re really dedicated. As I mentioned, I\\'ve, well, Jesus fucking Christ. I didn\\'t want to know what that is.</font><font color = \"#999999\"> Well</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\">, that\\'s a fucking creepy mask.</font><font color = \"#4daf4a\"> And that\\'s a.</font><font color = \"#999999\"> Fuck</font><font color = \"#999999\">,</font><font color = \"#000000\"> is</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\"> this weirdo? I</font><font color = \"#999999\"> don</font><font color = \"#999999\">\\'t think I want to know. No</font><font color = \"#999999\">,</font><font color = \"#4daf4a\"> that is not one of my friends.</font><font color = \"#999999\"> G</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\">-raver. We have a G-raver sighting. Oh</font><font color = \"#4daf4a\">, yeah, he\\'s got some freaky fucking kind of</font><font color = \"#999999\"> taxing his eyes</font><font color = \"#4daf4a\">. Yeah. Um, but no, this like I\\'ve, as I mentioned before, I went to an ICP wrestling event way back in the day and they sell their craft really hard, not just the wrestler, like the entire organization. I remember one point there doing a match where a barbed wire covered baseball bat was introduced into the match. Um, and</font><font color = \"#000000\"> at</font><font color = \"#4daf4a\"> one point, one of the wrestlers took the baseball bat and hit the referee in the head and I\\'m, and I\\'m, uh, you know, standing like eight feet away. So I see this here clearly. He hits him in the head, the, the referee falls face first to the ground and blood starts leaking out of the top of his head. Uh, now I realized there are ways to fake blood. You know, you can take a, like a little razor and cut yourself. Uh, you can have a blood pack in your hand and you\\'ll just hit that spot and you\\'ll make them make it look like blood coming from there. But I was pretty close. I saw that the baseball bat hit this gentleman\\'s head and him fall down face first. His hands never came anywhere near his head at that point. That guy legitimately took a fucking baseball bat covered in barbed wire to the head for the show.</font><font color = \"#000000\"> Yeah</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\">. Well, that guy\\'s stupid and yeah, you\\'ll never see like any of the big time people do something that retarded.</font><font color = \"#999999\"> No</font><font color = \"#4daf4a\">,</font><font color = \"#999999\"> no, that\\'s probably what they\\'re. Well, I\\'m with</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\"> you. He definitely has some titties.</font><font color = \"#999999\"> Yeah</font><font color = \"#4daf4a\">. T</font><font color = \"#999999\">itties. But</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\"> if he\\'s going to lactate, it\\'s probably going to be blood.</font><font color = \"#999999\"> Yeah</font><font color = \"#4daf4a\">. And I said, and they did also sort of stuff that this guy is doing too. Like, yo, hitting each other with fluorescent light bulbs. They had a thumbtack match, man. It was real thumbtacks. Uh, I could tell because at the end of the match, uh, all the wrestlers, their bottom of their like wrestling boots were covered in thumbtacks. That\\'s all you could see are silver for you. Uh, so the, the thumbtacks were, uh, at least sharp enough to go up into their, uh, shoes or boots rather. Uh, it\\'s, it\\'s a, it\\'s a fucked up thing. Some people will, what, what people will do for fame, you know, beyond the professional wrestling in general, which is a horrible, horrible for your body, just the, uh, other parts of it. Yeah. Oh</font><font color = \"#000000\">, now he</font><font color = \"#4daf4a\">\\'s going to jump.</font><font color = \"#999999\"> Is</font><font color = \"#999999\"> this a, I apparently</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\"> do doing a countdown of like his best or worst or what?</font><font color = \"#999999\"> Probably</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\"> both. So here he is jumping into a cake on top of barbed wire for its 21st birthday.</font><font color = \"#999999\"> Oh.</font><font color = \"#999999\"> Yeah</font><font color = \"#4daf4a\">. I don\\'t like, I don\\'t like even like watching those kinds of ones, because I can just think of the bar bar getting hooked on shit and stuff. Yeah. I think, you know, I think it was, that was the day that I realized I didn\\'t like horror movies when I was watching one of the Hellraisers. I don\\'t remember which one it was or anything like that. Are you familiar with any of the Hellraiser movies?</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\"> It\\'s been probably</font><font color = \"#000000\"> two</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\"> or three decades since I\\'ve seen any of them, but obviously yes, I know what they are.</font><font color = \"#999999\"> Right</font><font color = \"#4daf4a\">. Right. Well, there is one scene where there\\'s this chick standing there in front of like the evil box, which for some reason, I was a giant evil box instead of the small one at this point. I don\\'t know why. And she\\'s standing there talking to a dude when the, and like chains with hooks on the ends fly out of the box and hook out or, and like rip all of her skin off, like super quick and so she\\'s a stand there with no skin and the hooks hooking on the skin and stuff and just grossed me out to the point where I was like, okay, you know what? I don\\'t like horror movies. So like seeing him jump into the bar wire reminds me as her shit. I\\'m not a fan of those stunts.</font><font color = \"#000000\"> Yeah,</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\"> he\\'s just, yeah, this</font><font color = \"#000000\">, I don</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\">\\'t know</font><font color = \"#000000\">. I don\\'t know</font><font color = \"#4daf4a\">. You know, I feel like I\\'m watching like, you know, like a transvestite sex show. I don\\'t want to be interested in it, but I kind of am. But</font><font color = \"#000000\"> I</font><font color = \"#4daf4a\"> feel really bad about watching it.</font><font color = \"#000000\"> Well, you</font><font color = \"#4daf4a\"> just disconnect</font><font color = \"#000000\"> this</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\"> thing when you start chirping off like you would</font><font color = \"#999999\"> have</font><font color = \"#999999\">.</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\"> That\\'s a sex show. Okay,</font><font color = \"#999999\"> well</font><font color = \"#4daf4a\">, yeah, there are across</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\"> that line.</font><font color = \"#999999\"> There</font><font color = \"#4daf4a\"> are differences. Man, I kind of wish my wife was home actually. If nothing else, my dogs are always very depressed when she\\'s gone. You</font><font color = \"#000000\"> know</font><font color = \"#4daf4a\">, they just sit around and look sad. How does that make you</font><font color = \"#000000\"> feel</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\"> that they actually give a shit when she leaves?</font><font color = \"#4daf4a\"> Oh, not too bad. I mean, yeah, they\\'re her dogs. I, as I mentioned before, it was up to me. I want to get dogs. I, I don\\'t want to, I didn\\'t want to set myself up for the heartache. And the dogs love me, but they\\'re her dogs. You know, that\\'s fine.</font><font color = \"#999999\"> Right</font><font color = \"#4daf4a\"> now my little dog, Sadie, sitting on the</font><font color = \"#999999\"> couch</font><font color = \"#4daf4a\">, like three feet for me, just sulking. She doesn\\'t want up in my lap or anything like that. She did for the first couple of hours, but now she\\'s reached a point where she\\'s just inconsolable</font><font color = \"#000000\">. Oh boy, we got</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\"> another celebrity guest.</font><font color = \"#999999\"> I</font><font color = \"#999999\"> have a Gilbert</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\">. Gilbert</font><font color = \"#4daf4a\">, Jesus Christ. He looks like a Gilbert, doesn\\'t he? He</font><font color = \"#000000\">\\'s a</font><font color = \"#4daf4a\"> decorated champion, a champion of what I have. I\\'m assuming I guess I\\'m going to have to turn this up and see. I</font><font color = \"#000000\"> have a feeling they went</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\"> and they found like the cheapest celebrities they could find on Cameo.</font><font color = \"#000000\"> And just bought</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\"> them. No,</font><font color = \"#000000\"> I don\\'t</font><font color = \"#4daf4a\"> think these guys are like famous in any way, shape or form. I think these are all free. These are just like other idiots, you know, that, that have their own show. But you know, and they might, you know, well, super humans, like the king with his 200,000 subscribers and these guys are all, these are all guys of like a thousand subscribers or 5,000 subscribers or some sort of that shit doing all the same thing. They\\'re just not as popular as him. So I guarantee if you look up the Gilbert dude, he\\'s probably got an entire video channel him doing this kind of stupid shit too. No</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\">, Gilbert apparently was a former professional wrestler. It was actually like pretty big time for a while.</font><font color = \"#999999\"> Well</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\">, basically like a gimmicky kind of novelty thing. Oh</font><font color = \"#4daf4a\">, well, you know, true. He also looked like he was in a 60s or something. So.</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\"> Yeah. So like I,</font><font color = \"#000000\"> I</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\"> looked it up while we were talking here. Like he was back in like the</font><font color = \"#999999\"> late</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\"> 90s, early 2000s in there.</font><font color = \"#000000\"> Yeah. Yeah</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\">. He was a parody of the of Goldberg. Oh</font><font color = \"#4daf4a\">, really? On purpose?</font><font color = \"#999999\"> Oh,</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\"> yeah. Only he was, you know, like instead of a big jacked up dude, he was like,</font><font color = \"#999999\"> you</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\"> know,</font><font color = \"#999999\"> ten</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\">ors height, your weight. Oh</font><font color = \"#000000\">, so he wasn\\'t</font><font color = \"#4daf4a\"> in any real wrestling organizations or anything</font><font color = \"#999999\"> like that. Well, he was.</font><font color = \"#4daf4a\"> He was in like the WWE or some shit like that</font><font color = \"#999999\">. Yeah. He</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\"> was in the WWE. They were parodying Goldberg since he was a big deal and</font><font color = \"#999999\"> WC</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\">W.</font><font color = \"#000000\"> Oh, they</font><font color = \"#4daf4a\"> were like</font><font color = \"#999999\"> trying to take</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\"> the piss out of him. Oh</font><font color = \"#4daf4a\">, so not a real wrestler. So it\\'s</font><font color = \"#999999\"> a basic.</font><font color = \"#999999\"> Right</font><font color = \"#4daf4a\">. He saw he was just, he was just the guy that happened to get lucky and get like 15 minutes of aim. So okay. Yeah. Basically it fits my qualifications of what the type of people he\\'s going to get. People that are still chasing that last bit of celebrity. I</font><font color = \"#000000\"> refuse to be like, I refuse</font><font color = \"#4daf4a\"> to believe that now that the</font><font color = \"#999999\"> video kind</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\"> of clear up a little bit.</font><font color = \"#000000\"></font><font color = \"#e41a1c\"> He does have at least one good photo back there. Not a photo of him with anyone, but he has that autograph photo of iced tea</font><font color = \"#000000\">.</font><font color = \"#4daf4a\"> Oh, is that? Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. I can see that. Yeah. Then there\\'s another one that looks like whoopi Goldberg and somebody on the far or the top left. I could be wrong. I don</font><font color = \"#999999\">\\'t</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\"> think that\\'s whoopi Goldberg.</font><font color = \"#4daf4a\"> I don\\'t know. Yeah.</font><font color = \"#999999\"> Why definitely</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\"> is somebody black, but goddamn it, J. Or are you going racist again?</font><font color = \"#4daf4a\"> No, I</font><font color = \"#999999\"> just saw the I saw the dreads. Oh, it</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\">\\'s a black woman. That must be whoopi Goldberg.</font><font color = \"#999999\"> Okay</font><font color = \"#4daf4a\">.</font><font color = \"#999999\"> On the</font><font color = \"#4daf4a\"> top right hand side, that is a mankind or whatever that wrestler was. But I</font><font color = \"#000000\"> don</font><font color = \"#4daf4a\">\\'t know</font><font color = \"#999999\">.</font><font color = \"#4daf4a\"> I don\\'t know. Yeah. That\\'s Nick Foley. Yeah. I\\'m not sure if that\\'s necessarily a picture of him or not, but it\\'s Nick Foley with somebody else. So that would</font><font color = \"#000000\"> be</font><font color = \"#4daf4a\"> kind of funny to see though. I might do that if I ever have some sort of video feed. I\\'m just going to go out on eBay and buy a whole bunch of celebrity photographs of with other people. Hang up on you just celebrities. I like and find photographs of that. They took her people and hang them up on my wall. It\\'s like, yeah, I got a signed photograph of, you know, of iced tea and some guy from Cleveland.</font><font color = \"#999999\"> Yeah</font><font color = \"#4daf4a\">, you</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\">\\'re just. That</font><font color = \"#000000\">\\'d</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\"> be funny</font><font color = \"#999999\">,</font><font color = \"#999999\"> dude</font><font color = \"#4daf4a\">. That\\'d be funny. Okay</font><font color = \"#999999\">. Now, God</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\"> damn nerd.</font><font color = \"#999999\"> Now</font><font color = \"#4daf4a\"> they\\'re going to do a flying elbow drop onto action figures with</font><font color = \"#999999\"> a. Oh</font><font color = \"#999999\">,</font><font color = \"#4daf4a\"> he. Oh, and he did it with a friend too. So.</font><font color = \"#999999\"> Oh</font><font color = \"#4daf4a\">, okay. I can tell the difference in the parking. That\\'s that\\'s my wife.</font><font color = \"#999999\"> Oh</font><font color = \"#999999\"> boy.</font><font color = \"#999999\"> Yeah</font><font color = \"#4daf4a\">, because it\\'s not a parking. It\\'s whining. Now</font><font color = \"#000000\">,</font><font color = \"#4daf4a\"> I don\\'t know if you can hear that the difference.</font><font color = \"#999999\"> Yeah</font><font color = \"#999999\">,</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\"> I get a little bit there.</font><font color = \"#999999\"> Yeah</font><font color = \"#4daf4a\">, samey parks, but but Lulu makes these weird whiny sounds. I think</font><font color = \"#000000\"> it\\'s something</font><font color = \"#4daf4a\"> to do with her being abandoned. She freaks out when mama comes home.</font><font color = \"#000000\"> But well,</font><font color = \"#4daf4a\"> but.</font><font color = \"#999999\"> Apparently</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\"> the guy on the left, that was the one that was jumping with him into the action figures in VCR. Ah</font><font color = \"#000000\">, and</font><font color = \"#4daf4a\"> they rewarded him with his own commentary job. That\\'s great. But</font><font color = \"#000000\"> he, like he</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\">\\'s also apparently also like a professional wrestler. I</font><font color = \"#000000\"> don\\'t know</font><font color = \"#4daf4a\">. I think you\\'re throwing around that term. You know</font><font color = \"#000000\">,</font><font color = \"#4daf4a\"> pretty, I guess it depends on how loosely you want to take that term, but you know, professional as in not doing it for fun. I guess there</font><font color = \"#999999\">\\'s a. Well, I don\\'t</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\"> know like on national TV professional</font><font color = \"#999999\">.</font><font color = \"#4daf4a\"> Really?</font><font color = \"#999999\"> My</font><font color = \"#4daf4a\"> God. Wow. Yeah, I mean, I don\\'t follow wrestling in any way, shape, or form, but I assume that there\\'s just a higher, higher threshold that anybody that\\'s actually doing, you know, W. W kind of shit would wouldn\\'t touch this if it\\'s 10 foot pole. What</font><font color = \"#999999\"> the</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\">. That Oh God, some actual professional wrestling organization invited super human. It looks like.</font><font color = \"#999999\"> Yeah, you see</font><font color = \"#4daf4a\"> that\\'s what I mean. If you consider this a professional wrestling organization, then yeah, I guess you probably has a lot of professional wrestlers on there. Because</font><font color = \"#000000\">, you know,</font><font color = \"#4daf4a\"> this is a like literally there\\'s a ring and probably 10</font><font color = \"#999999\"> 20 40. That looks like they always</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\"> have a full door.</font><font color = \"#999999\"> Yeah. They got quite</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\"> the budget. They have half doors. Yeah. This</font><font color = \"#4daf4a\"> looks like about what 50 or 60 people. They could get a good guess.</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\"> Yeah, they\\'re definitely in like a fucking bingo hall or something. Yeah</font><font color = \"#4daf4a\">. And yeah, but hey, it\\'s it\\'s professional wrestling at a certain level, right? I mean, those people, those guys paid to get into the show. So these guys are all pros regardless of how much I want to make fun of them. Yeah</font><font color = \"#000000\">, they</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\">\\'re actually working and making money for it right now, which is, I mean, it\\'s kind of a step up from you</font><font color = \"#000000\">.</font><font color = \"#4daf4a\"> Yeah, no kidding. I just say the ship free and hope some days someone might pay me for it. Yeah. I\\'m</font><font color = \"#000000\"> not listening</font><font color = \"#4daf4a\"> to the audio. So I don\\'t know</font><font color = \"#999999\">. Yeah, I don\\'t really</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\"> care about the professional wrestler cutting a promo. Don\\'t really care. Yeah</font><font color = \"#4daf4a\">. See</font><font color = \"#000000\">, it\\'s hard to take this</font><font color = \"#4daf4a\"> part seriously. No, no. So you</font><font color = \"#000000\"> guys super</font><font color = \"#4daf4a\"> human trying to talk shit to the guy. I think I just pushed them halfway across the ring.</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\"> And the great thing is, it\\'s like he\\'s never even</font><font color = \"#999999\"> like</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\"> you would think someone so obsessed with professional wrestling and doing this stupid shit would know how to like take a back bump</font><font color = \"#000000\">.</font><font color = \"#999999\"> Yeah</font><font color = \"#999999\">. He just</font><font color = \"#999999\"> got</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\"> thrown down. Yeah</font><font color = \"#4daf4a\">. At least they didn</font><font color = \"#000000\">\\'t</font><font color = \"#4daf4a\"> try to do a whole wrestling thing. They didn\\'t leave the ring after that point. Yeah. I wouldn\\'t want to see the party guy get hurt. And I\\'ll do</font><font color = \"#999999\"> this going</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\">. So I\\'m assuming he\\'s going to get hurt here.</font><font color = \"#999999\"> Oh,</font><font color = \"#4daf4a\"> man.</font><font color = \"#999999\"> No, no, no, get in the</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\"> ring, right? No</font><font color = \"#000000\">, it\\'s</font><font color = \"#4daf4a\"> you get River, you know, he\\'s fighting the heel. He\\'s got to win now. So he hit the guy with a folding chair, which</font><font color = \"#999999\"> is</font><font color = \"#4daf4a\"> traditional, I guess. And now</font><font color = \"#000000\"> they</font><font color = \"#4daf4a\">\\'re actually wrestling</font><font color = \"#999999\"> sort</font><font color = \"#4daf4a\"> of. Oh</font><font color = \"#000000\"> my</font><font color = \"#999999\"> God</font><font color = \"#999999\">.</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\"> Boy</font><font color = \"#000000\">, he</font><font color = \"#4daf4a\"> sold that</font><font color = \"#999999\"> pretty good. That\\'s pretty cool</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\">. Shit. I think I\\'ve ever seen.</font><font color = \"#999999\"> What</font><font color = \"#4daf4a\">\\'s I called? I don\\'t know what that move is called.</font><font color = \"#000000\"></font><font color = \"#999999\"> That was the</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\"> old stone cold stunner.</font><font color = \"#4daf4a\"> Yeah, he did still cold</font><font color = \"#999999\"> stunner out of people</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\"> actually did watch wrestling and it</font><font color = \"#999999\"> was entertaining</font><font color = \"#4daf4a\">. Yeah.</font><font color = \"#999999\"> Yeah</font><font color = \"#4daf4a\">. Oh, Jesus Christ. That</font><font color = \"#000000\">\\'s why I</font><font color = \"#4daf4a\"> understand he\\'s clearly, clearly interesting. You would think that he would like</font><font color = \"#999999\"> his</font><font color = \"#4daf4a\">, I don\\'t</font><font color = \"#999999\"> know. He worked</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\"> out one in his life</font><font color = \"#999999\">.</font><font color = \"#4daf4a\"> Yeah, exactly. I don\\'t know. Maybe he maybe he seemed like he\\'s an active user. As I mentioned before, his diet just must be terrible,</font><font color = \"#999999\"> terrible</font><font color = \"#4daf4a\">, terrible.</font><font color = \"#000000\"> I don</font><font color = \"#4daf4a\">\\'t know. We need to get home lender and oh look fucking tenors on here. You guys need to hop on a fucking, you know, we\\'ve still got like another 15 or 20 minutes or something like that. Oh my God. The dude\\'s up to $42,000 so far that they\\'ve donated to this show. I\\'m in the wrong line of work, dude. Jay</font><font color = \"#000000\">,</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\"> we need to get you to do some extremely stupid shit. I can host it and we can</font><font color = \"#999999\"> split</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\"> the profits 50-50. [</font><font color = \"#999999\">laughter</font><font color = \"#000000\">]</font><font color = \"#4daf4a\"> That seems fair.</font><font color = \"#999999\"> Hey</font><font color = \"#4daf4a\">,</font><font color = \"#999999\"> since</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\"> you\\'re taking all the risk, okay, 55-45.</font><font color = \"#4daf4a\"> Oh, I appreciate that man. I need to look out for me. I don</font><font color = \"#000000\">\\'t care what</font><font color = \"#4daf4a\"> people say about you. You\\'re a good dude. This is</font><font color = \"#999999\"> funny</font><font color = \"#4daf4a\">. He needs to, he actually needs to speed it up. We\\'re not going to get this done in an hour. Unless he\\'s, unless he gets it moving. Well, he</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\"> did start late. So there\\'s only two things left. There\\'s this and then the main event</font><font color = \"#000000\">.</font><font color = \"#4daf4a\"> Oh yeah, no, I\\'m free. Yeah, he\\'s got, yeah, you\\'re right. He did start late. So, I mean, we\\'ll run a little bit over. Obviously, we\\'re not going to cut it off if he\\'s about to do the stunt at the right at the end of the show. Oh</font><font color = \"#000000\">,</font><font color = \"#4daf4a\"> I am. He goes and</font><font color = \"#000000\"> tell</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\"> fucking midnight. We\\'re staying with him.</font><font color = \"#4daf4a\"> Oh God, dude, I\\'m tired. Tired hungry. I want to eat. Quit</font><font color = \"#999999\"> your bitch</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\"> in</font><font color = \"#999999\">.</font><font color = \"#4daf4a\"> I know. It\\'s all for the good of the show. He is. He\\'s</font><font color = \"#999999\">. He\\'s. Joe, you\\'re a</font><font color = \"#999999\"> boat</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\"> of kids. It</font><font color = \"#999999\">\\'s</font><font color = \"#000000\"> a boat</font><font color = \"#4daf4a\"> of kids. So is Wu Tang</font><font color = \"#999999\">. At least</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\"> it\\'s a good escape from all the crazy shit that\\'s going on</font><font color = \"#000000\">.</font><font color = \"#999999\"> Yeah, true. You\\'re</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\"> just watching a guy that\\'s a complete idiot make full of himself. Like, what better?</font><font color = \"#999999\"> Yeah</font><font color = \"#4daf4a\">, exactly. Normally, I have to look in a mirror for that. So this is good. I will, you know, it\\'s funny. Now that I\\'m back into the workout or routine.</font><font color = \"#999999\"> You</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\"> bar both of $10.</font><font color = \"#999999\"> Oh</font><font color = \"#999999\">,</font><font color = \"#999999\"> yeah</font><font color = \"#4daf4a\">.

Nice</font><font color = \"#999999\">.</font><font color = \"#4daf4a\"> Nice. That\\'s a record so far, man. Who\\'s we can\\'t we can\\'t find somebody to send us $429. And 69 cents.</font><font color = \"#999999\"> Where</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\">\\'s Sly? He\\'s rich. Yeah</font><font color = \"#4daf4a\">.</font><font color = \"#999999\"> Yeah</font><font color = \"#4daf4a\">. See, and here I was feeling bad about the oh yeah. I\\'m sorry. Greg Colin again. I have a</font><font color = \"#000000\"> I</font><font color = \"#4daf4a\">\\'m watching the show. So I can\\'t I can\\'t see the Colin most of the time. There you go. Lost.</font><font color = \"#999999\"> Oh</font><font color = \"#4daf4a\">, I get I hit. Yes, but he hit no.</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\"> Oh, well damn. Yeah</font><font color = \"#4daf4a\">, come on</font><font color = \"#999999\">. I did I did</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\"> figure out how to do the the video into</font><font color = \"#999999\"> the</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\"> YouTube feed. So it is there now</font><font color = \"#000000\">.</font><font color = \"#999999\"> All</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\"> right. Watch watching YouTube and follow along. They can do that. One problem with the YouTube feed apparently it bombed out and I had to reconnect. So I think we\\'re missing like the first 15 minutes</font><font color = \"#000000\">.</font><font color = \"#4daf4a\"> Oh, well, that\\'s not a big deal. This is a</font><font color = \"#999999\"> working project. Anything</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\"> is really happening here</font><font color = \"#999999\">. Right</font><font color = \"#4daf4a\">. Exactly. All</font><font color = \"#999999\"> right</font><font color = \"#4daf4a\">. Now let\\'s try it again. What</font><font color = \"#000000\">\\'s up</font><font color = \"#4daf4a\">, Canada?</font><font color = \"#000000\"> Hey</font><font color = \"#ff7f00\">, boys. Hey, what are you guys watching? You have some rustling bullshit. I\\'m</font><font color = \"#999999\"> watching</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\"> superhuman live. It\\'s this absolutely ridiculous human. It like just jumps into stupid shit. It\\'s kind of like jackass. Only</font><font color = \"#999999\"> like</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\"> there\\'s a good chance he might have like a learning disability.</font><font color = \"#999999\"> Yeah</font><font color = \"#4daf4a\">. Okay.</font><font color = \"#999999\"> So</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\"> go to you go to YouTube and type in superhuman but spell the human part H U M U N</font><font color = \"#000000\"> N. Just superhuman with two ends at the end. Is it? I was saying he\\'s got a live string going on or something. Yes, he does. Yeah. Yep. As we speak, he\\'s about to fuck himself up again. Yeah. He\\'s about to slam his hands into rat traps and cactuses or cacti. Cacti. You\\'re grammatically correct. How black is he? A little black or full black? He\\'s juggle a white. Okay. So. Palm strike. Ow. Oh, there he goes. He\\'s doing it again. Oh, he\\'s the head buddy. One of the cat guy. Oh, he\\'s over the direct track trap. Oh, yeah. He\\'s bleeding. Yeah. Okay. Now he\\'s off to the rat trap. He\\'s going to slap his head on the rat trap right about. Here we go. He\\'s getting himself geared up. I don\\'t know. Wow. Did he miss it? No, that got him. He\\'s in the fetal position. Hey, do you guys watch the FedEx fucking thing, man? You know what? That person like I ran over honestly was an idiot, but I felt sorry for that fucking person. Man, like, wow, what a way to go away. Oh, I know. So I\\'ve been avoiding all fucking news. Like I\\'m. Oh, dude. I\\'m over this shit at this point. Yeah. I haven\\'t watched a damn thing today. I\\'ve just been geared myself up for the superhuman live. And I think he broke his finger, man. It\\'s a pro a protester against the okay. So superhuman like just say a Japanese guy. How do you spell it? Super. And then the and then it\\'s human H U M A N N. And then just put like, okay, after it and you should be able to find it. A and okay. Super human with two ends. Yes. Two M\\'s H U M M A N. It\\'s you. No, you have it wrong. It\\'s H U M A N N. Oh, the the the feed says H U M M A N. Oh, well, that\\'s weird. Hey, my break is. Yeah. Oh, let me check it out. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. This. Yeah, this is a. And everything. And the thing is, you know what PJ for the first time you\\'re right. It\\'s H M M A N. Yeah. Hey, good job, Jack. Yay. I like at that warm glow. Now, I guess apparently they\\'re talking about old stuncies done as well, because they\\'re trying to fill time because they want you to watch this as much as possible. Well, you also you do have to give him a little bit of time to, you know, Oh, recover. Yeah. Recuperate between doing stupid shit. Okay.</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\"> Another show on the clip of someone else grabbing him and body sl</font><font color = \"#000000\">anting him down onto the the normal fluorescent light bulbs. And slow mode. Oh, so I was good. I think. Yeah. But then that Russell do that. What the fuck is his name? Geez, mankind. He did the he did the shit. Oh, yeah. Yeah. He did all sorts of shit like that. But generally, like those guys are trying to do it in a safe way. This guy\\'s just doing shit in his backyard. Yeah. It\\'s a pretty it\\'s pretty amazing. The fact that he hasn\\'t actually seriously injured himself, because clearly he doesn\\'t know what the fuck he\\'s doing. And in a way, he\\'s kind of irresponsible that we\\'re all encouraging this shit. But I\\'m not going to tell him to stop. Hey, with everything going on in the world today, like we need an escape. All right. Yeah. Okay. They drug. Okay. It looks like he\\'s getting ready for the last step. Is that our where it is upon us? The main event. Yeah. That\\'s right. So he is favoring that hand. I think he may have broken a finger. Look at that. He\\'s even gripping with it. Yeah. Yeah. Now, before he joined us, Grad, we were talking about the fact that for every dollar that someone donated to this show, he added a thumbtack to the amount and the kiddie pool there. And he\\'s up to somewhere around $42,000 worth of thumbtacks. So there\\'s a little over 40,000 thumbtacks in there. So in addition to all the money that he\\'s making up. He\\'s making a nice profit. Like it\\'s going to cost him probably around $1,500 to go to his hand fixed. Right. Yeah. Could you know the way nobody gives this guy fucking health insurance? Holy shit. Well, he made it what his deductible is at this point. Oh, I had it. He had it back. Yeah. No, I was going to say me and Ryan in the fucking room, was this fucking working hard this and that. I got Ryan. Let\\'s fucking do fucking some crazy. Yeah. Shit like this, man. Yeah. I don\\'t know if it\\'s worth it. On the other hand, he\\'s probably going to make a bunch of money off of like the monetization of this feed. You know, that $40,000 is upfront. How\\'s he going to get all the back end shit too? I don\\'t think he\\'s making much of anything on like YouTube monetization. This is not advertiser friendly at all. Right. But I mean, oh, so I assume there\\'s going to be some. I guess we\\'ll have to go back and look and see what they had any answer the this after it feeds over her because he\\'s not going to be right now. Obviously. Well, I guess I don\\'t know. So I always have ad blockers and shit. So. Oh, yeah. Me too. Like if you have like boring YouTube and no ad blockers. Yeah, you check that out. Okay. Oh, yeah. No, yeah. I got have no I have a blackers as well. I shit. Always amazed when someone doesn\\'t have it. They\\'re like, oh, I\\'m his ad black up to that. I\\'m like, what? What are you from the year? 1999 or something dude? Ad blockers have been around fucking forever now. Yeah. I haven\\'t seen a YouTube ad for ever. Well, I mean, other than the ones that are like inherent part of it. You know, I don\\'t get pop up ads. But oh, you know, I you know, it\\'s on my phone. That\\'s right. Because I still remember the ads before the video. You can\\'t really avoid those. Well, on your phone, maybe. Yeah. But yeah, like we\\'re actually watching it on a on a PC. I haven\\'t seen it adding years. You know, I wonder if my hand black takes care of that. Because I haven\\'t really thought about it. But you\\'re right. I guess I don\\'t. Cool. So yeah, you check out Superhuman after this on your phone. See if he if he does have ads. I\\'d be surprised if he does. Because like there is nothing advertiser friendly about what he does. I don\\'t know. Yeah, maybe I maybe he maybe he gets ads from other wrestling and organizations. That seems like a good place to advertise for them. Well, that would be like paid promotion. Like we\\'re talking about like YouTube money. Oh, yeah. Yeah, you\\'re right. Yeah. Oh, let\\'s see. I guess I\\'m watching this. How society is fucking falling down. This or fucking making money. The four the four fathers or sisters or whatever are fucking turning in their grace. Holy fuck man. Yeah, I know. 20 years ago and they made millions off this shit. They did. But at the same time though, again, it was it was. That it worked for some reason. I\\'m saying right. If I could work, it was crazy. But at the same time, they\\'re breaking balls. Like a bunch of guys go to Daytona Beach, whatever. You know what I\\'m saying? Had that vibe. Right. Exactly. Yeah. No, you\\'re right. 100,000 YouTube followers. So. No, no. He\\'s up there. No, graduate. Jack has definitely a different vibe to it. It was a whole bunch of friends that were being idiots together. They didn\\'t give me the vibe that they were intellectually challenged. Like a superhuman does. On Jackass, it was a whole bunch of friends basically daring each other to do stupid shit. And breaking balls. Yeah. Right. Right. Yeah. Yeah. Superhumans is more of like, you know, a guy being left unsupervised that really shouldn\\'t be. Oh, stop it, Jay. Always so serious. So back to Ryan\\'s recommendation, Ryan, I agree. And I think as I posted this, please do a check back on the street, man. I\\'ll fucking pay. Well, fucking, well, we\\'ll set up a fucking fund, dude. I\\'ll have to see how well they are. 7 for 6 guy, dude. Well, get the fun. Oh, gee fun. Go on this net and then get you to fucking ask questions. What the fuck? Hey, come on. I\\'ll have to check and see how well the costume is spared. As I mentioned, there was a flood in my basement a couple of years ago. And I don\\'t think it got to my got to my costume, but I was afraid to check. So I think it\\'s fine. The thing with that is the mask sucks so bad. It\\'s pretty much unusable. It\\'s so goddamn big that you can\\'t get no matter what I did. I couldn\\'t get it to hang in a certain way that the eye holes match it up to my face. So it was a big, pretty big disappointment. Even better. 7 for 6 fucking guy asking questions and fucking doing the odd, our like, trabock thing. Well, they can tell if superhuman can make, dude, we\\'ll fucking be rich. I mean, look at this right now. They\\'re doing an intermission to for like, I think stuff that they\\'re selling. Yeah, he sold the app space apparently for him. I don\\'t know. Dude, I think I\\'m on grad side on this. This is fucking retarded man. I feel dumb that I\\'m watching it. I\\'m just hoping for the benefit. I want to see him get hurt one more time and then I\\'m good to abandon the CI damp. But it\\'s going to be glorious him diving into a pool filled with thumbtacks and light bulbs. Yeah, yeah, you know, I haven\\'t feeling that the payoff isn\\'t going to be what I think we think it is. I mean, at this point, I\\'m so annoyed with this entire redneck circus that he would basically have to jump into the pool and explode into a like cloud of blood. Right. Circus. Come on, Jay. You have fucking freezer flaps for a dog door. Yeah. God, him inflatable hot tub that you have in a goddamn garage. Well, you think we don\\'t. Right. A tricycle. Oh, fuck. You think we don\\'t know our own? I think I\\'d be better at identifying it than anybody else, really. Is this like you being angry about the Big Bang Theory? Because it takes advantage of your nerds. You feel exploited right now. I feel a little exploited. Okay, he\\'s back and it looks like he really probably did break his hand. Rat traps will do that, by the way. Yeah. That\\'s a broken finger. That\\'s absolutely a broken thing. That might. Yeah, that\\'s a broken finger. Yeah. Well, so this podcast is so gay, not even tenors calling in. You might be. He might be. I\\'m not paying any attention to the fucking chat. He\\'s watching me. He\\'s watching. He\\'s fucking wondering what the fuck am I doing? It\\'s not what the fuzzers fucking. What\\'s this kid? Five foot two? Is that why you build juice, right? Or be whatever. Why do you build juice? That\\'s our boy superhuman. That\\'s a. Now, I\\'ll be honest with you, I think he\\'s probably medicated the shit out of himself before he did this show because looking at him, he looks a little about a loopy side. What do you guys think? Well, he has jumped through two things and broken fingers already. Yeah. Yeah. So yeah, I think he might be. He might have a little bit. Oh, it\\'s a hot sauce onto the glass. Oh, yeah. Because reasons, I guess. For reasons, yeah. You know, you don\\'t want those spicy wounds, dude. That\\'s fucking hurts even worse. Jesus Christ. Yeah, I know. Okay. Now, what\\'s he going to jump off of? Or is he going to play? Oh, Jesus Christ. Really? Okay. This is going to be fucking amazing. Oh, Jesus Christ. Oh, okay. He\\'s this tiny lister. They\\'ve officially gotten a famous person to get on this show. And yeah, now. You\\'re a cameo. This is the cameo. It has to be. Yeah. I was about to say, I apologize, Ryan. You were 100% right. That was one. That was definitely a cameo thing. Is that a dude for? Is that a dude from Candyman? No, no, this is the guy from Friday. Oh, yeah. I don\\'t know who played in Candyman. It\\'s like an answer. But yeah, he was in Friday. Oh, D-bo\\'s coming. Hide your way. Hide your fucking necklace. I\\'ll tuck in their shit in. All right. Come on, buddy. Now, I will say if he\\'s going to jump off of the trampoline into that and I assume land on his back, that would fucking hurt like a motherfucker. If there wasn\\'t anything on there, you know, just the flat out ground. Yeah, this one\\'s going to not feel good. Yeah, because like he doesn\\'t have anything to fall through. Like he\\'s going straight into the goddamn ground. Yeah, yeah, exactly. You can\\'t you.</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\"> I wonder how he intends to land</font><font color = \"#000000\"> that. Stick it yellow. It\\'s like he going for a belly flop. He\\'s going to land on his back. He\\'s going to butt it. I think it\\'ll be probably more of like a elbow kind of drop where he lands kind of on his hip. Oh, Jesus. Jesus. So nothing good. I mean, I can\\'t think of a good landing for that. The thing is, I\\'m going to log off because I can watch this. But I think it\\'s really unfortunate. This guy obviously has mental issues and people are kind of pushing to watch this. Reason why people like this have suicides, but whatever it is, whatever it is, it\\'s fucking all fucking media and that. But guys, you guys have a great night. I\\'m going to log off. Got both of us. All right, Canada. You have a great night, boss. All right. Yeah, well, super humans not for everybody. I understand that. You live now band in Canada. Hey, I understand where he\\'s coming from. It\\'s not for everybody. I have my misgivings about watching it as well. I mean, not enough to turn away. I think I\\'m going to go ahead and finish</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\"> it off. Maybe you wasn\\'t making a shit ton of money and didn\\'t have a huge following and isn\\'t actually enjoying the way he\\'s living life. Like, yeah, I\\'d have more of a problem with it. Like, no one\\'s putting him up to it.</font><font color = \"#999999\"> Right</font><font color = \"#4daf4a\">,</font><font color = \"#999999\"> right</font><font color = \"#4daf4a\">. He doesn\\'t have like three older friends that are tricking their younger and not so bright brother into doing stupid shit. Yeah, he\\'s an adult who\\'s making a fair amount of money doing this shit. So was there an original person that led them into this that should be ashamed of themselves? Probably. I mean, probably somebody else</font><font color = \"#999999\">. Professional</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\"> wrestling. Like, it\\'s professional wrestling</font><font color = \"#999999\"> and</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\"> probably Mick Foley,</font><font color = \"#999999\"> because he did a lot</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\"> of those crazy, like stupid stunts in, like big-time wrestling. You can tell</font><font color = \"#999999\"> he\\'s kind</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\"> of an awkward kid who loves wrestling, decided he was going to, you know? Right</font><font color = \"#000000\">, right</font><font color = \"#4daf4a\">.</font><font color = \"#999999\"> That was a</font><font color = \"#999999\"> good</font><font color = \"#984ea3\"> one</font><font color = \"#999999\">.</font><font color = \"#4daf4a\"> Yeah, but my point being, I think</font><font color = \"#999999\"> if</font><font color = \"#4daf4a\"> he didn\\'t, if there wasn\\'t a group of people or a person out there somewhere where he did it the first time, I said, \"Oh, dude, those fucking funnies fuck. Do some more.\" You</font><font color = \"#999999\"> know</font><font color = \"#4daf4a\">, there is an original person responsible for this shit. He didn\\'t just start doing it in his backyard for nobody watching. Yeah</font><font color = \"#999999\">.</font><font color = \"#999999\"> But</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\"> there\\'s 200,000 people that are responsible then.</font><font color = \"#999999\"></font><font color = \"#4daf4a\"> Now, there is now, but like I said, I don\\'t, I agree. I said, \"I don\\'t feel too bad about watching it now because obviously it\\'s a thing, you know, that he likes doing, he\\'s making money on it.\" But as I mentioned, there is an original person that\\'s responsible for this shit that should probably be ashamed of themselves. At one point, someone would have showed us, said, \"No, dude, don\\'t do that, dude.\" I think</font><font color = \"#000000\"> probably</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\"> the first and most responsible for it is, \"Hi</font><font color = \"#999999\">,</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\"> I\\'m Johnny Knoxville.</font><font color = \"#999999\"> Welcome to JFPS.\" Yeah</font><font color = \"#000000\">,</font><font color = \"#4daf4a\"> yeah, yeah, yeah. That\\'s probably true, too. Yeah. Don\\'t pay any attention to the, you know, the notice before this, that says, \"Don\\'t do any of this shit at home.\" Because really, do the shit at home, dude. We made</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\"> a million dollars off of this. It\\'s like, \"You\\'re probably going to do it at home.\"</font><font color = \"#999999\"> Yeah</font><font color = \"#984ea3\">, no</font><font color = \"#999999\"> kidding</font><font color = \"#4daf4a\">. Man</font><font color = \"#999999\">,</font><font color = \"#4daf4a\"> there\\'s, I hit</font><font color = \"#000000\"> my</font><font color = \"#4daf4a\"> mixed things about them as well. What, so when do you go like take a shower or something? No, he</font><font color = \"#999999\"> went</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\"> and put on a dress. I assume</font><font color = \"#4daf4a\"> there\\'s probably a reason for that that I\\'m unaware of</font><font color = \"#000000\">.</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\"> I think it was one of the levels of</font><font color = \"#999999\"> donation</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\"> that he hit. Okay</font><font color = \"#4daf4a\">. And they\\'re giving out the money again. Let\\'s see if anyone\\'s worth a shout out. No</font><font color = \"#000000\">, no</font><font color = \"#4daf4a\">, no</font><font color = \"#999999\">. Yeah, we\\'re all pretty low right now. A bunch</font><font color = \"#4daf4a\"> of $1 and $2 bitches. Yeah, you guys don\\'t even get worried. You guys don\\'t even get talked about. That\\'s right. No</font><font color = \"#000000\">,</font><font color = \"#4daf4a\"> no, no. Come on. We need to have some big money here. No,</font><font color = \"#999999\"> just</font><font color = \"#4daf4a\"> a bunch of, well, they all add up, I suppose. But not enough, if you don\\'t get</font><font color = \"#999999\"> it. Yeah, you have thousands of people</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\"> to give you a dollar. Like you made some money. So</font><font color = \"#000000\"> when</font><font color = \"#4daf4a\"> donated, $</font><font color = \"#999999\">86. Way</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\"> to go, Zicky Dice.</font><font color = \"#4daf4a\"> Yeah, we\\'ll make fun of anybody who does less than a dollar too. That\\'s totally fair</font><font color = \"#999999\"> play. I didn\\'t even</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\"> know that would be an option</font><font color = \"#999999\">.</font><font color = \"#4daf4a\"> Yeah, I know. See, I mean, I don\\'t know</font><font color = \"#999999\"> who we talked about. You can</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\"> probably cost more to like actually do that payment than, you</font><font color = \"#999999\"> know, these guys are giving</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\"> them. I mean,</font><font color = \"#999999\"> who might have talked? It was</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\"> probably like 90 cents</font><font color = \"#999999\">.</font><font color = \"#4daf4a\"> Right. I mean, not that I\\'m one to talk. Yeah, we have people throw pennies at us on a regular basis.</font><font color = \"#000000\"> Hey, now you</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\">\\'re</font><font color = \"#999999\"> wrong. We</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\">\\'re making a hail now and then that</font><font color = \"#4daf4a\">\\'s right. Hey, yeah, I don\\'t mind the penny throwing at me every once in a while. I could use the cash. All right. It looks</font><font color = \"#999999\"> like you started going up to it</font><font color = \"#4daf4a\">. Yeah. Like</font><font color = \"#999999\"> you</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\"> could tell he\\'s fucking bane.</font><font color = \"#999999\"> Yeah</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\">, yeah, it was</font><font color = \"#4daf4a\"> a good hand too. You didn\\'t think about that. Next time you go throwing your hand into a rat trap, you might want to use your off-hand. Oh, look at this dude. Another cameo, I assume. A shaggy two-dope is now on the show. I don</font><font color = \"#999999\">\\'t</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\"> know. This one might be for freaks. I mean, he starts out every one of his stunts with this is for all my juggalos and juggalets. So now you</font><font color = \"#000000\">\\'re back in</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\"> on this.</font><font color = \"#999999\"> Yeah</font><font color = \"#999999\">, no, no, no. I\\'m going to buy the one. I</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\"> see peak, cameo. And by</font><font color = \"#999999\"> the</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\"> way</font><font color = \"#999999\">, just the fully</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\">, fully invested</font><font color = \"#000000\">.</font><font color = \"#4daf4a\"> No, and that is by the way, the less talented of the two. So.</font><font color = \"#999999\"> He</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\">\\'s the skinny one, right</font><font color = \"#999999\">?</font><font color = \"#4daf4a\"> Yeah, yeah, yeah. He\\'s also probably the one that\\'s more likely to actually stab you. They\\'re both neither of them are from the Southwest Detroit, like they say, they\\'re from Ferndale, which is like a suburb of Detroit. Granted, it is like the first suburb north of Detroit, but it\\'s still not Detroit. Yeah</font><font color = \"#000000\">,</font><font color = \"#4daf4a\"> Eminem kind</font><font color = \"#999999\"> of</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\"> slaughtered them to that.</font><font color = \"#999999\"> Yeah</font><font color = \"#999999\">.</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\"> When they were talking about him,</font><font color = \"#999999\"> when</font><font color = \"#000000\"> yes, he might be a skinny white dude, but like he was from Detroit to Detroit. Yeah, the, yeah, and then these guys not so much. And now they did like once they hit famously, moved to Detroit. They had a like a warehouse in Southwest Detroit, like a three-story warehouse that they had like a wrestling ring, and all like a shit in. But yeah, for the most part, they\\'re, you know, they\\'re not hard card gangsters. The only reason they\\'re called the insane clown posse is because when they first started out, they wanted to call themselves the inner-city posse, but that sounded like too much like a real gang name. So the real gangs gave them shit until they changed their name to the insane clown posse. Yeah, you know, way too much about this, Jay. Well, you know, growing up in Detroit around people that were juggalozy, you learned this kind of stuff. So, you know, I would have learned like the good music though. You would have like, you would have picked up on Eminem and Royce to 5\\'9\" and proof before he died and just like that. No, and these are all things people that I\\'ve heard of, but you know, I wasn\\'t really in the rap, so that I didn\\'t listen to the ICP either. Thank God, because if I wasn\\'t in the rap, but back then I might have listened to him. God knows where I\\'d be now. Oh shit, here he goes. He\\'s on the trampoline. Oh, don\\'t do it superhuman. I don\\'t want to see it, man. It\\'s not worth it, man. You\\'ve already got the money. They won\\'t make you give it back, dude. You can back out of it right now, because that\\'s a pretty high trampoline too. That\\'s at least four feet up in the air today, right? If not higher. What do you think? Yeah, probably about four feet. He\\'s like five foot nothing. Right. Yeah. Come on, dude. You won\\'t be able to catch yourself with that right hand. Remember that. You got to roll to your left, not to your right, buddy. If he braces himself with that hand and breaks more of it, yeah, I can\\'t. Oh, okay, I got to turn this on. Oh, that\\'s where I got to hear the impact. Yeah, I\\'ll turn it up a little bit for the stream too, because his screaming after this is going to be wonderful. There we go. This should be audible for the YouTube folks. Oh boy, here we go. I\\'ll wait it all day. He has 2,280 people watching this. Goddamn right. And we\\'re doing our part. Yeah. Mind you, I\\'m not giving him a goddamn red scent, but still. But yeah. Dangerous as fuck sometimes. Does he just call it? Holy shit, and the bottle\\'s still there. Oh my God. That\\'s not a good. Good bottle. That\\'s going to. That\\'s going to suck. I hope it\\'s a I hope that\\'s a plastic bottle. I mean, he could he could kill himself down there. That was a hot sauce battle. Like that\\'s a pretty thick glass. Oh God. Oh man. That\\'s don\\'t do it, dude. I it\\'s I. They\\'re plugging for extra money. They\\'re saying he might need a full body scan after all this. Oh my God. Yeah, they should probably just give him a head CT.</font><font color = \"#4daf4a\"> Yeah. Oh</font><font color = \"#999999\">,</font><font color = \"#4daf4a\"> here we go. Like</font><font color = \"#000000\"> this</font><font color = \"#377eb8\"> is slow</font><font color = \"#999999\"> rolling</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\"> it. Yeah.</font><font color = \"#000000\"> Holy</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\"> shit. He</font><font color = \"#000000\">\\'s just</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\"> got five grand. No</font><font color = \"#000000\">, the guy</font><font color = \"#4daf4a\"> paid five thousand dollars for an ad basically.</font><font color = \"#999999\"> Basically</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\">, but.</font><font color = \"#000000\"> Oh, yeah,</font><font color = \"#4daf4a\"> really</font><font color = \"#999999\">.</font><font color = \"#999999\"> Which</font><font color = \"#4daf4a\"> means basically</font><font color = \"#000000\">, I</font><font color = \"#4daf4a\"> think he hit fifty thousand dollars or some shit like that. That</font><font color = \"#999999\"> is</font><font color = \"#4daf4a\"> insane. Or you know what? I have to go look it up again. I thought I might have heard something like if he hits a hundred thousand, he\\'ll do the golden dunk.</font><font color = \"#999999\"> So</font><font color = \"#999999\">.</font><font color = \"#999999\"> That can\\'t</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\"> be a hundred grand. There\\'s there\\'s not that many stupid people out there</font><font color = \"#000000\">.</font><font color = \"#999999\"> You</font><font color = \"#4daf4a\">\\'d be surprised.</font><font color = \"#999999\"> There he goes.</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\"> No</font><font color = \"#000000\">, it\\'s a</font><font color = \"#4daf4a\"> hundred thousand, dude. Who</font><font color = \"#000000\">op whoop whoop</font><font color = \"#377eb8\"> whoop</font><font color = \"#999999\">.</font><font color = \"#377eb8\"> Here we go.</font><font color = \"#999999\"> Fuck</font><font color = \"#377eb8\"> this shit. Godd</font><font color = \"#000000\">amn</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\"> it. It\\'s like three frames per second.</font><font color = \"#4daf4a\"> Oh. And he came down on the right side too. Oh</font><font color = \"#000000\">,</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\"> yeah</font><font color = \"#999999\">.</font><font color = \"#999999\"> Yeah</font><font color = \"#4daf4a\">, he</font><font color = \"#999999\">\\'s</font><font color = \"#999999\"> leading</font><font color = \"#4daf4a\">. He\\'s leaking from the elbow. From the elbow drop. He\\'s got these got some tax stuck in his skin. And looks like some glass from the from the fluorescent light</font><font color = \"#999999\"> bulb</font><font color = \"#4daf4a\">. Yeah, it\\'s not a good look guys. I\\'m pretty sure he\\'s going to die. It\\'s this is it right here. Yeah, he\\'s not</font><font color = \"#999999\"> bleeding</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\"> that much. Come on, Jay.</font><font color = \"#999999\"> No,</font><font color = \"#4daf4a\"> not really. He\\'s fine</font><font color = \"#999999\">. He\\'s fine</font><font color = \"#4daf4a\">. He</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\"> just drink some toss in and walk it off</font><font color = \"#999999\">.</font><font color = \"#4daf4a\"> Yeah, yeah. No, he\\'s fine. Oh, nice. He\\'s puking up the hot sauce a little bit. Because apparently he\\'s hot sauce.</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\"> Why does he go to it so much?</font><font color = \"#4daf4a\"> I don\\'t know. What was</font><font color = \"#000000\"> he going</font><font color = \"#4daf4a\"> to do? Is he going to do a second time? Now</font><font color = \"#999999\"> I</font><font color = \"#4daf4a\"> looked down if you go</font><font color = \"#999999\"> on it. If you\\'re watching. They</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\"> talk him into this. I\\'m</font><font color = \"#000000\"> sure you</font><font color = \"#4daf4a\"> will. I\\'m sure it\\'s part of the show. But</font><font color = \"#000000\"> if</font><font color = \"#4daf4a\"> you look down, I hit the more because we\\'re looking at the live feed. If you roll down, it can see you. 20,000, all the different levels of the. Okay, you</font><font color = \"#999999\"> know</font><font color = \"#4daf4a\"> what? I</font><font color = \"#000000\">\\'ve</font><font color = \"#999999\"> vastly</font><font color = \"#4daf4a\"> overestimated how much money they\\'ve given him. Because here\\'s what the deal is. For every $1, I\\'ll add another 10 tax to the mix. So they\\'ve reached 100,000 tax, which means they\\'ve dated $10,000. So he\\'s doing all this shit for $10,000, not $100,000.</font><font color = \"#999999\"> So</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\"> he\\'s going to jump back through another door. Looks like with the light tubes on it. The</font><font color = \"#999999\"> light tubes didn</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\">\\'t break. Yeah</font><font color = \"#000000\">,</font><font color = \"#4daf4a\"> so okay, so he\\'s not making quite as much as I thought. But still,</font><font color = \"#000000\"> so he\\'s</font><font color = \"#4daf4a\"> making 10 grand off this. Bless</font><font color = \"#000000\"> him</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\">.</font><font color = \"#000000\"></font><font color = \"#4daf4a\"> Yes, indeed. Yeah</font><font color = \"#000000\">, see, at</font><font color = \"#4daf4a\"> 100,000, I was considering the sort of ship, but I wouldn\\'t do all this for 10 grand, dude. But as you mentioned, that\\'s two grand in the year after the show\\'s over, right? Yeah</font><font color = \"#000000\">, he</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\">\\'s got to get that fucking finger set.</font><font color = \"#000000\"> [silence]</font><font color = \"#984ea3\"> All right, here\\'s it. Okay</font><font color = \"#000000\">, here\\'s</font><font color = \"#4daf4a\"> the finale, I think. This</font><font color = \"#000000\"> is his</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\"> encore, if it were a concert.</font><font color = \"#999999\"> Yeah</font><font color = \"#4daf4a\">. And did you catch that apparently they\\'re in Florida to surprise a fucking nobody? Oh</font><font color = \"#000000\">, so</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\"> he is Florida, man. Yeah. Oh</font><font color = \"#000000\">, that was</font><font color = \"#4daf4a\"> a nice little roll into it, you know? That\\'s,</font><font color = \"#000000\"> I\\'m surprised. Yep, his back\\'s</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\"> bleeding.</font><font color = \"#377eb8\"> Yeah. [sil</font><font color = \"#000000\">ence]</font><font color = \"#4daf4a\"> Oh,</font><font color = \"#999999\"> and</font><font color = \"#4daf4a\"> I\\'m left exactly how I felt I would be, you know, just like, you know, after masturbating to something really, really, really, really wanchy. Now, I\\'m feeling deflated and embarrassed and ashamed of myself. I</font><font color = \"#000000\"> don\\'t feel ashamed</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\"> to one bit. Oh, man</font><font color = \"#999999\">. This was</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\"> glorious.</font><font color = \"#000000\"> Ah, well</font><font color = \"#4daf4a\">, you know. Is</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\"> that his mom?</font><font color = \"#4daf4a\"> Yes, it is. She wants her dress back. [</font><font color = \"#999999\">laughter</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\">] Even better.</font><font color = \"#999999\"> Yeah</font><font color = \"#4daf4a\">. Well</font><font color = \"#999999\">,</font><font color = \"#4daf4a\"> folks, it was definitely something to see. I\\'m glad we did this shit, and if he does another one, I\\'m not doing it again. [laughter] Oh</font><font color = \"#999999\">,</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\"> no, if he does this, we\\'re absolutely doing these. Oh, okay.</font><font color = \"#4daf4a\"> It</font><font color = \"#999999\">\\'s actually up</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\"> there fucking riots everywhere. Like, this is a good escape from all the crazy shit going on.</font><font color = \"#4daf4a\"> Yeah, that\\'s true. I was so entranced that, you know, like, they could have been burning on my house, and I wouldn\\'t have noticed. So there is that to be said about it. And</font><font color = \"#999999\"> maybe</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\"> you are in Detroit.</font><font color = \"#4daf4a\"> Yeah, it is true. Now, we\\'re going to be back tomorrow, folks, at our normal time at six o\\'clock. I appreciate everybody stopping by for this special edition of The Other Ground Live. I want to thank the O.G.A.R.E. for showing up in the chat box. We can\\'t do the show without you. Right, you got anything? Yes,</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\"> I have two things. I</font><font color = \"#999999\"> think</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\"> something that is probably something that we absolutely need to touch on here, being what we just watched, and that is... Whoop, whoop,</font><font color = \"#000000\"> whoop</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\">, whoop.</font><font color = \"#999999\"> And secondly</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\">,</font><font color = \"#999999\"> fuck</font><font color = \"#e41a1c\"> all y</font><font color = \"#999999\">\\'</font><font color = \"#999999\">all</font><font color = \"#4daf4a\">. Everybody have a great night. We\\'ll see</font><font color = \"#000000\"> you tomorrow at six. (music)</font><font color = \"#377eb8\"> Go, go,</font><font color = \"#999999\"> hipp</font>'"
